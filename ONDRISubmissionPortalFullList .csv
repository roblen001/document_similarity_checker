27,Frederico Pieruccini-Faria,Association Between Gait Speed and Activities of Daily Living Across Neurodegenerative Disorders: An ONDRI Study.,"In our article published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease 2017 describing the ONDRI Gait and Balance protocol we postulated that motor performance across neurodegenerative disorders is an important marker of disease progression and disability. The gradual loss of independence to perform activities of daily living (ADL) is the most important precursor of disability, and can be accelerated by chronic diseases that impacts motor and cognitive performances. Hence, neurodegenerative disorders may accelerate the decline in ADLs given their devastating impact on motor and cognitive performances. Gait speed is one the most, if not the most, important global motor indexes, known to be modulated by higher-level cognitive functions (e.g. fast thinking, planning and multi-tasking). Not surprisingly, gait speed is a predictor of ADL in older adults in general. It is unclear, however, whether and how gait speed is associated with ADLs across different neurodegenerative disorders. It is also unknown whether the context in which patients have their gait performance tested in laboratory settings would help reveal significant associations between gait speed and ADLs. Experimental conditions for gait testing can challenge motor-cognitive interactions frequently required during ADLs, which may be useful to expose associations between gait speed and ADL capabilities in patients.","This proposal will test 3 hypotheses: 1- Slower Single-task gait will be associated with both fewer ADLs and impaired global cognition across neurodegenerative disorders; 2- Slower gait assessed during a walking-while-talking condition (i.e. dual-task) will be associated with fewer ADLs, but only in neurodegenerative disorders with greater impact on cognition: Mild Cognitive Impairment/Alzheimer's disease, Cerebrovascular Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia; 3 - Slower gait speed assessed under higher motor stress (i.e. walking as fast as possible) will be associated with fewer ADLs but only in neurodegenerative disorders predominantly affecting motor control including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.","Participants' demographics, clinical characteristics, gait performance, genomics, cognitive performance and neuroimaging variables at baseline will be extracted from ONDRI databases. The following variables will be used in the study: Gait speed during single-, dual-, fast- task conditions; basic and instrumental ADLs questionnaires; MoCA (Global cognition); Trail Making Test B, Stroop Tests; Symbol Digit Test; APOE-4 genotype at baseline; White matter hyperintensities volume, Normal Appearing White matter volume and Normal appearing Grey Matter Volume adjusted for total brain volume at baseline.","Gait speed tested under single-task, dual-task and fast walking at baseline will be entered as predictors of basic ADLs, instrumental ADLs and Global cognition in a multivariate model (MANOVA). ADLs will be logarithmic transformed to obtain data normality. Gait speed will be adjusted for, age, sex, years of education, cognitive performance, number of comorbidities, APOE-4, white matter hyperintensities volume. This adjustment will be performed through standardized residuals extracted with linear regression models for each gait variable. An aggregate score of executive functions will be entered as a covariate in the analysis when a significant association between gait speed and ADLs are identified. If the association is attenuated or become stronger by more than 10%, then we will consider executive functions as an important mediator of this association. ROC analyses will determine gait speed values to be used as cut-offs for ADL and global cognition impairment.","Clinically, through gait performance cut-offs, clinicians could better estimate disability prognosis in patients with neurodegenerative disorders using a simplified and inexpensive assessment. Mechanistically, this knowledge will pave the path to validate gait speed as biomarker of neurodegeneration. "

Predictive features of cognitive impairment can be identified to dichotomize ALS patients into those who may or may not develop FTD. ","This pan-Ontario study aims to prospectively and systematically characterize the cognitive dysfunction in a cohort of subjects with ALS. Cognitive deficits will be correlated with ALS progression/phenotype and genotype along with changes in ocular motility, gait, and structural imaging. In this way, we aim to identify features predictive of cognitive impairment in ALS. Results will then be compared and contrasted to the other neurodegenerative diseases in the study. ",ALS clinical features and multimodal platform evaluations. ,"Multivariable analyses of ALS phenotype (ALSFRS-R, bulbar vs limb dysfunction) with results of multimodal testing (cognition, saccades, genetics, gait and imaging).

Biomarkers may also be identified that can serve as reliable therapeutic targets in future clinical trials. 
OND20141104DM,Douglas P Munoz,Using eye movements to identify cognitive and motor impairments in neurodegeneration,"Previous studies have investigated individual disease groups and identified specific abnormalities in voluntary saccade control between the disease group and age matched controls: e.g., Alzheimer's (Peltsch et al. 2014); Mild Cognitive Impairment (Peltsch et al. 2014); Parkinson's disease (Chan et al. 2005; Cameron et al. 2010; 2012); amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Witiuk et al. 2014). Some of the differences are unique to a disease and others overlap between diseases. The ONDRI provides the unique opportunity to contrast deficits in voluntary saccade control across neurodegenerative disorders to identify similarities and differences that help identify unique behavioural biomarkers.",The aim of this paper is to describe the similarities and differences in control of saccades in the various patient groups followed by ONDRI.,"Patient behavior while completing the interleaved pro/antisaccade task. We will analyze saccade metrics (amplitude, velocity, duration, accuracy, curvature), reaction times, direction errors",NA,The goal is to identify different behavioural biomarkers that are unique or common between the patient groups. This analysis and paper will form the basis for eye tracking data driving correlations/investigations across the other platforms. The study will be based on the analysis of behavior from all 600 patients in the initial patient uptake (2014-2015).

A subsequent study will include evaluation of the genetic load in this population (genetic risk factors for PD, other neurodegenerative diseases, vascular diseases, neuroinflammation) establishing cognitive and other clinical phenotypic differences from those lacking these factors (i.e. 'reverse phenotyping'). The next stage of the evaluation of the baseline data will be to compare and contrast the findings in PD with those of the other disease states participating in ONDRI. ","150 patients with PD of 3-8 years duration stratified by baseline cognitive function (MoCA > 24 and MoCA 19-24) will undergo extensive multimodal ONDRI assessments. The first publication of the PD group will attempt to determine 1) which clinical characteristics predict and correlate with early cognitive dysfunction (as defined on detailed neuropsychological testing as well as the screening MoCA) (e.g. poor levodopa response, greater axial disability); 2) what abnormalities (nature and extent) on the other ONDRI multimodal evaluations predict and correlate with greater cognitive dysfunction (e.g., pattern/severity of alteration in MRI atrophy; greater degree of cerebrovascular changes; specific changes on retinal coherence tomography; greater dysfunction on eye tracking measurements; greater dysfunction on gait analysis). ",Baseline results of all clinical and multimodal evaluations (except genetics). ,"Multivariable analyses adjusting for relevant confounders will be used to examine associations between neuropsychological tests (dependent variable) and UPDRS scores/subscores, MRI findings, OCT measurements, eye movements and gait measures.

OND20141118CT,Miracle Ozzoude ,Investigating the contribution of white matter abnormalities to neuropsychiatric symptoms and changes in social behaviour and personality for patients with Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Neurodegenerative diseases, in addition to cognitive and motoric impairments, also includes neuropsychiatric symptoms and changes in social behaviour and personality. Some neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy and aberrant motor behavior are core to a diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and we know that neuropsychiatric symptoms have been described in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Vascular disease dementia and related to white matter hyperintensities. The prevalence of NPS across the whole spectrum of FTLD including bvFTD, nfvPPA, svPPA, PSP, CBS and FTD-MND and their relationship to WMH is unknown.   Neurodegenerative diseases, in addition to cognitive and motoric impairments, also include neuropsychiatric symptoms and changes in social behaviour and personality.

The prevalence of NPS across all neurodegenerative  diseases and their relationship to WMH is unknown.  Changes in empathy and personality are core to the bvFTD phenotype but these may also be affected in other neurodegenerative diseases. A lack of understanding that these illnesses can affect empathy and personality can lead to frustration and grief in caregivers.

OND20141118MM,Manuel Montero-Odasso,Gait and motor phenotype in neurodegenrative disorders.  A protocol for gait and balance analysis for ONDRI (paper 1),"Recent epidemiological studies are showing that motor slowing and slow gait may predict cognitive decline to dementia.  However, it is unknown if this motor decline is part of the motor phenotype across different neurodegenerative disorders.  The ONDRI project provides a unique opportunity to explore common motor abnormalities across the spectrum of aging and neurodegenerative disorders.",To describe a unique protocol/design to assess the potential motor phenotype in neurodegenerative disorders.,Gait and balance performance across the spectrum of ONDRI participants.,N/A,This protocol can set a standardized mobility and gait assessment in neurodegenerative research.

OND20141124AR,Angela Roberts,Language and motor speech patterns in Frontotemporal Dementias,"While multiple researchers have investigated the the profiles of cognitive and language abilities in PPA, several 'gaps' in the existing literature exist including:   1) Comprehensive motor speech profiles among clinical FTD subtypes,   2) Comprehensive language and cognitive profiles for PSP, CBD, and behavioural FTD subtypes   3) Comprehensive spoken language profiles (i.e., discourse) among clinical FTD subtypes   4) Comprehensive cognitive, language, and motor speech profiles for genetic subtypes of FTLD   5) Detailed analyses using larger sample sizes that correlate profiles of cognitive, language, and motor speech profiles with subtype-specific patterns of cortical volume measures and more importantly DTI which has been shown to discriminate FTD subtypes (Santillo et al., 2013).   The comprehensive measures collected in the ONDRI protocol facilitate the development of discriminative profiles among FTD subtypes that may improve diagnostic clarity for both management and research purposes. Importantly, such a copious analysis of these data will improve our understanding of the phenotypic representation of the underlying, neuroanatomical, neurocognitive, and neurolinguistic signatures among these dementia subtypes which will inform our knowledge of the underlying substrates for disrupted cognitive and language processes that have both theoretical and clinical implications within FTD and extending to other disorders. ","General hypothesis: Individuals with FTD will demonstrate subtype-specific (clinical diagnosis subtypes and genetic subtypes) cognition, language, and motor speech profiles that are associated with subtype-specific differences in measures of cortical volume and DTI.   Aim 1: Investigate differences in cognitive, language, and motor speech profiles (performance-based standardized measures and spoken language) among clinical diagnostic groups (PSP, CBD, FTD including PNFA, semantic, logopenic, and behavioural variants).   Aim 2: Exploratory nvestigation of differences in cognitive, language, and motor speech profiles (performance-based standardized measures and spoken language) among genetically confirmed subtypes of FTD (e.g., C9orf72).   Aim 3: Correlate cognitive, language, and motor speech profiles with measures of cortical volume and DTI among FTD (clinical and genetic) subtypes. ","1. Standardized measures of cognition, language, motor speech, and discourse data from the neuropsychology and language protocol.   2.

Access to neuroimaging data for measures of cortical volume and DTI   4. Access to genetic testing data ","Where appropriate GLM analysis methods will be used to analyze group differences among measures of interests. If the data allow, discriminant function analyses will be used to create profile algorithms that best discriminate among the clinical and genetic subtypes. Standardized and accepted imaging processing and analysis procedures will be used to correlate profiles of cognitive, language, and motor speech performances with patterns of cortical volume and DTI changes among subtypes. ","Significance / Value 	The current publication will contribute significantly to the existing body of literature relative to discriminative profiles (behavioural and imaging) among FTD subtypes. As outlined above, this work has important theoretical and clinical implications that extend beyond FTD.   Only data collected from the FTD disease group will be used in these analyses. This publication will support cross-disease group data analyses anticipated by the neuropsychology and neuroimaging platforms. "
OND20141126CE,Carrie Esopenko,The incidence of remote TBI across neurodegenerative diseases: relation to genotype and brain imaging findings,"There is substantial evidence that a remote history of TBI increases the risk or lowers the onset age of neurodegenerative disease. This relationship may be modified by genotype. This research is typically conducted within a single disease and not across neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, there is little evidence relating TBI history such as neuroimaging and behavioural measures in neurodegenerative diseases. As the ONDRI project includes both a detailed history of TBI and comprehensive neuroimaging and behavioural measures, it is poised to address these shortcomings.  This project dovetails nicely with our CIHR-funded research on aging, neurodegenerative disease, genetics and TBI in former high-level athletes, which also includes multimodal neuroimaging, neuropsychological measures, and genetics. Whereas our athletes study looks forward from the perspective of relatively young individuals with a remote TBI history, the proposed research looks backwards in time from the perspective of individuals already diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease, with and without a TBI history. ","General Hypothesis: Remote TBI history will be associated with an increased risk of dementia, as well as lower the age of onset of disease.   Aim 1: To assess the contribution of TBI across different neurodegenerative diseases  Aim 2: To determine if this relationship is modulated by possession of an ApoE ε4 allele, the BDNF met allele, and the COMT val allele (all associated with negative outcomes following TBI and neurodegenerative disorders), relative to those with a protective version of these genotypes.   Aim 3: To determine if this relationship is reflected in the profile of neurobehavioral deficits (by contrasting neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric status in those with and without a remote history of TBI).  Aim 4: To determine if this relationship is reflected in the profile structural and functional MRI changes (by contrasting patterns of atrophy, white matter integrity, and resting state functional connectivity in those with and without a remote history of TBI). ","1)	Participant demographic information    2)	Outcomes from TBI interview (timing, frequency, and severity of TBI).   3)	Structural and functional MRI data  4)	Neuropsychological test data  5)	ApoE, BDNF, COMT status","Tract based spatial statistics in FSL will be used to analyze DTI data. Freesurfer will be used to measure cortical atrophy. Conn toolbox from SPM will be used to assess resting state functional connectivity.   Diagnostic, genetic grouping, and behavioral data will be analyzed with standard general linear model. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis will be used for data integration",There are millions of Canadians with exposure to TBI due to other causes that may or may not confer increased risk of unhealthy brain aging or dementia. Recent high impact research on this topic has been from a neuropathological perspective. There is a vital need for in vivo studies of brain structure function to better understand the relationship between TBI and dementia.
OND20150504AD,Ayan K. Dey,Resting state fMRI and behaviour in Vascular Cognitive Impairment,"Recent meta-analyses have shown that vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) resulting from vascular disease is associated with cognitive decline most pronounced in domains of attention, executive functioning and speed of processing. Despite the high prevalence of VCI, the neural basis of these executive function and attention deficits are not well understood. While there is a well-established positive association between degree of cognitive decline and presence of cerebrovascular changes (e.g. diffuse white matter hyper-intensities and lacunar infarcts) on MRI, the clinical relevance of these changes as captured by standard imaging remain unclear as not all individuals with such lesions have cognitive complaints. Some of this disparity may stem from the fact that while standard clinical imaging provides an excellent means for identifying lesions and white matter hyper-intensities, it does not necessarily permit assessment of changes in functional connectivity of brain networks that support cognition. Indeed recent studies suggest that behavioural deficits commonly associated with VCI may closely relate to disruption of functional networks responsible for higher order cognitive functions.   A powerful new way of quantifying/ characterizing the brain's functional systems is the use of a graph theoretical approach which is well suited for analysis of complex networks. Using graph theory, subtle changes in resting state brain networks (e.g. strength of inter-connectivity between brain regions) can be identified. ",The primary objective of this study is to investigate the neural correlates of cognitive deficits in individuals with vascular cognitive impairment using a combination of neuropsychological testing and graph theoretical analysis of resting state functional neuroimaging data.   General Hypothesis: We hypothesize that vascular cognitive impairment will be associated with altered functional connectivity within established resting state functional networks independent of age.   Aim 1: Correlate neuropsychological profile with changes in functional network connectivity within well-established resting state networks associated with cognitive control and attention with age as a covariate.   Aim 2: Correlate neuropsychological profile with changes in functional network connectivity between well-established resting state networks associated cognitive control and attention with age as a covariate.   Aim 3: Correlate neuropsychological profile with changes in whole-brain functional network connectivity with age as a covariate. ,1. Resting state fMRI data   2. Structural MRI data for analysis of vascular lesion burden   3. Performance on standard neuropsychological tests.   4. Relevant demographic profiles of participants ,Graph theoretical analysis using a publically available toolbox called 'GraphVar' as well correlation and regression analysis between graph theory metrics and performance on neuropsychological tests. Age and site location will be treated as covariates.,A better understanding of the impact of vascular disease on whole brain network dynamics and accompanying cognitive impairments may help uncover novel brain-behaviour biomarkers. Such biomarkers may serve as reliable therapeutic targets in future clinical trials and help clinicians dichotomize patients into sub-groups which in turn could influence treatment guidelines.
OND20150504PM,Paula McLaughlin,ONDRI Neuropsychology Platform: Using a Principal Component Analysis Approach to Understand Cognitive Profiles across Five Neurodegenerative Conditions ,"The ONDRI Neuropsychology Platform protocol provides a comprehensive assessment of cognition across five neurodegenerative conditions. Given the depth and breadth of this protocol coupled with the multitude of associated outcome variables, it is important to understand the structure of the battery and facilitate data reduction by identifying components that represent common factors contributing to cognitive performance. In addition, capturing group similarities and differences in cognitive profiles at baseline is an important goal of ONDRI. ","The primary objectives of this study are (a) to reduce the number of outcome variables in the Neuropsychology protocol through exploratory factor analysis, and (b) to investigate cognitive profile similarities and differences between disease groups based on the components identified in the factor analysis.   General Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the number of outcome variables will reduce to a smaller number of components. These components will subsequently differentiate patient groups; however, similarities are anticipated for some of the cognitive factors.   Aim 1: Principal component factor analysis (exploratory) on standardized neuropsychology outcome measures across participants at their baseline visits will be used to reduce the data and identify cognitive components.   Aim 2: Cognitive composite scores based on the factor analysis results will be calculated for each participant and scores will be compare across disease groups.   Aim 3: Discriminant analysis will be used to explore whether cognitive composite scores (based on the factor analysis) can differentiate disease groups effectively.

OND20150504SB,Sandra Black,MCI/AD Disease Theme,"Dementia is a problem of growing proportion affecting our rapidly aging population. Whereas the commonest single cause may be Alzheimer's disease (AD), the mechanisms underlying this disorder are unknown, co-morbidities are the rule and not the exception, and there are no effective disease-modifying treatment or prevention strategies. The same applies to amnestic single or multi-domain mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), thought to be the prodromal stage of AD, which in most cases evolves into this Alzheimer's dementia. The multidisciplinary, multiple cohort ONDRI study is designed to advance our knowledge of aMCI, AD, and other neurodegenerative diseases, with the hope of bringing us closer to understanding these disorders, including co-morbid small vessel disease, and to spur development of treatment and prevention strategies. The first publication of the ONDRI MCI/AD group will focus on methodological challenges related to the MCI/AD theme, and baseline clinical data involving each of the ONDRI platforms as applied to MCI and AD.

OND20150615AT,Angie Troyer,The clinical utility and characteristics of face-name association in neurodegenerative populations ,"Associative memory involves remembering relations between items of information, such as which words were presented together in a word-pair memory task. Associative memory is sensitive to brain changes related to normal aging, MCI, and other conditions impacting hippocampal integrity. Associative memory tasks using face-name pairs have the added benefit of ecological validity, as this is the most common memory complaint in normal and many memory-disordered populations. Our previous research has shown that a face-name associative recognition task is sensitive to early cognitive changes in individuals with amnestic MCI who are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia, and that it correlates with hippocampal volumes and ApoE genotype (Troyer et al., 2012, Neuropsychologia). We are proposing several studies, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, that will add to this knowledge base by examining the utility of face-name associative recognition in predicting the development of AD in those initially identified with MCI and in discriminating between disease processes with varying degrees of hippocampal involvement. ","The aim is to further understand the clinical utility and characteristics of face-name association in neurodegenerative populations. Specific queries will include:  1.	Sensitivity of face-name associative recognition in discriminating between participants with MCI who later develop AD versus remain stable with MCI  2.

OND20150615KS,Komal Shaikh,Understanding the clinical utility of sleep quality in individuals with MCI and AD,"Sleep fragmentation and reduced duration are common disturbances reported in normal aging. Mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease are associated with similar yet more severe sleep disturbances. Sleep disruptions are common in dementia and may lead to worsening memory because of interrupted memory consolidation during sleep. Recent research suggests that sleep quality plays a critical role in preserving cognitive function and reducing the risk of dementia (Landry & Liu-Ambrose, 2014).  Sleep quality also seems to differ between men and women, with women reporting greater complaints regarding sleep quality and an increased prevalence of sleep disorders during specific time points, such as menopause (Mallampalli & Carter, 2014). We are proposing several studies, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, that examine the utility of sleep quality in predicting the development of AD in those initially identified with MCI. ","The primary aim is to understand the clinical utility of sleep quality in individuals with MCI and AD. Specific aims include the following:  1.	We will explore sex differences in sleep quality within MCI and AD populations.    2.	We will explore the relationship between sleep quality and measures of cognition (memory and attention) in MCI and AD populations.   3.	We will investigate the relationship between sleep quality and quality of life and instrumental activities of daily living  4.	We will investigate additional factors, including genetics and cognitive reserve, that may act as moderators of the relationship between sleep quality and dementia.   5.	We will investigate the sensitivity of sleep quality in discriminating between participants with MCI who later develop AD versus those who remain stable with MCI.

We will perform a two-way ANOVA with sex and sleep quality as independent variables and dementia severity as a dependent variable.   2.	We will calculate a correlation to see if better sleep quality is associated with better performance on cognitive measures, within MCI and AD groups.  3.	We will perform correlational analyses between sleep quality, quality of life and instrumental activities of daily living.   4.	We will perform a regression analysis with genetic susceptibility to AD and cognitive reserve (as indicated by years of education) as moderator variables and sleep quality (at baseline) as a predictor variable for group membership at subsequent follow-ups.   5.	We will perform a regression analysis with sleep quality (at baseline) as a predictor variable for group membership at subsequent follow-ups. ","Understanding how sleep quality varies in different stages of AD may lead to better clinical assessment and diagnosis (particularly for early-stage disease) and may help with the development of targeted interventions (e.g., sleep interventions)."
OND20160201AT,Angie Troyer,"Intraindividual Variability in Identifying, Classifying, and Predicting Cognitive Impairment","Intraindividual (or within-person) variability (IIV) is defined as short-term, rapid, reversible fluctuations in performance and is a reliable, measurable characteristic of an individual's behavior. IIV provides unique information about cognition that is not otherwise captured by traditional measures of performance accuracy or speed. Over and above these other measures, IIV tends to uniquely predict meaningful outcomes such as everyday functioning, falls, the presence of cognitive impairment, cognitive decline, and even impending death.  In our own research, we have shown that IIV on face-name and word-word associative memory tests is elevated in older relative to younger adults (Vandermorris et al., 2013, Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition). It is also elevated in MCI relative to age-matched controls and is a unique predictor of diagnostic group membership (MCI vs normal) over and above performance accuracy (Troyer et al., in review). Other research has shown elevated IIV in a number of other neurological populations, including cerebrovascular conditions, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's Disease, frontal-temporal dementia, and other dementias.  Measures of IIV thus have the potential to add useful diagnostic information to clinical assessments. Because IIV can often be calculated from performance on tests that are administered for other reasons as part of an existing assessment battery, examining IIV can enhance the efficiency of clinical evaluation procedures.  We are proposing several studies, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, that will involve examining IIV in reaction times on the face-name associative recognition test that is included in the ONDRI neuropsychology platform. ","The overarching aim is to explore the utility of IIV in identifying, classifying, and predicting cognitive impairment. Specific hypotheses include:  1.	Within and across disease groups, elevated IIV on face-name association will be associated with greater general cognitive impairment (on the MoCA and on executive and memory measures within the neuropsych battery), more severe region-specific changes in frontal and temporal areas, and more extensive evidence of diffuse small vessel pathology on MRI.  2.	Elevated IIV on face-name association at baseline will be associated with more rapid decline over subsequent longitudinal assessments within each disease group. Within the MCI subgroup, elevated IIV at baseline will be associated with a higher risk of developing dementia at follow-up.  3.	Across the sample, IIV on face-name association may be elevated to differing degrees in the five specific disease groups (e.g., FTD > AD). We will explore the utility of using IIV measures to differentiate all five disease groups. If control data become available in the future, we would also expect that IIV data would discriminate those with neurodegenerative disease from controls.  4.	Within and across disease groups, elevated IIV on face-name association will be associated with decreased gait, balance, and gait variability, as well as saccade/anti-saccade variability.  5.	Within and across disease groups, the relationship of IIV on face-name association to genetic variables will be explored.    Within the context of this overarching program of study, our first project will focus on hypothesis 1, above.","•	Participant demographic information    •	Neuropsychological test data: Face-name association task and selected other tasks  •	MRI: Structural and functional connectivity data  •	Gait: gait velocity, balance, gait variability  •	Eye tracking: saccade/anti-saccade data  •	Genetics: genotyping data    For our first project, study variables will include the first three listed above.","We will utilize MANOVA analyses to examine group differences on IIV measures of interest. Logistic regression analyses will be used to explore the unique predictive value of IIV relative to other cognitive measures. MANOVA analyses will be used to explore change over time. Correlations will be used to examine relations between IIV, MRI and genotyping variables.",Measures of IIV have the potential to add useful diagnostic information to clinical assessments in an efficient manner.
OND20160506CS,Chris Scott,An overview of the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) pipeline development and neuroinformatics for quality assurance and quality control of magnetic resonance imaging data,"The tools and techniques that are employed for MRI quality control and assurance vary greatly from study to study, addressing different aspects of the many challenges faced when undertaking multi-scanner and multi-site research. Since there is currently no consensus on the steps that should be undertaken to ensure high quality data acquisition and management, sharing the processes of the ONDRI project will be of benefit to the broader imaging and neuroinformatics communities alike.","To describe the procedures employed by the ONDRI project for maximal quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) in the acquisition and management of MR imaging data from a large multi-site, multi-disease cohort, longitudinal, observational study.",Scanner performance data from both subject scans and phantom scans,"This publication will examine and describe in detail all aspects of data management and (QA/QC), including but not limited to: initial MR imaging protocol development and multi-scanner/site harmonization efforts both locally and within the context of the Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol (CDIP), automatic naming convention adherence pipelines, automatic MR imaging protocol parameter adherence monitoring pipelines, automatic signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) quantitative pipelines, automatic resting state fMRI scanner performance monitoring pipelines using the fBIRN tools (both subject and phantom  acquisitions), automatic pipelines for monitoring and correction of MR scanner geometric gradient field distortions (Lego® phantom), automatic pipelines for assessment of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), manual quality assessment for motion and other imaging artefacts, and aspects of the neuroinformatics backbone in Brain-CODE integrating all of these features for deployment, execution and recording/databasing of all relevant information and data generated from these procedures.

OND20161019MM,Manuel Montero-Odasso,The role of gait variability in neurodegenerative disorders (paper 2),Gait variability has been proposed as a sensitive marker of central neurological control of mobility in general and gait dynamics and navigation in particular. Emerging evidence show gait variability is altered in cognitive disorders and our lab has pioneered this kind of analysis in MCI and AD; however this find has not been replicated in neurodegenerative diseases beyond Alzheimer's disease.,"	To describe the magnitude of gait variability in the entire neurodegenerative cohort within the ONDRI study and to compare with healthy age-matched controls already available in the Gait and Brain Study (PI: Dr. Montero Odasso)","Demographic data, cognitive scores, and gait and balance performance across the spectrum of ONDRI participants.",ANOVA (cross-sectional comparisons)  ,This will be the first attempt to explore gait variability across several degenerative disorders compared to controls.  The study will be based on the analysis of cognitive scores and gait and balance from all ONDRI participants. This will not impact at all on the longitudinal studies but it will establish the baseline to compare for the longitudinal studies.
OND20161024KS,Komal Shaikh,Sleep Quality and VCI,"Sleep fragmentation and reduced duration are common disturbances reported in normal aging. These sleep disturbances, particularly daytime sleepiness, are associated with an increase in vascular disease events (Elwood et al., 2006). Research from the Caerphilly Cohort Study, a longitudinal study following men aged 55-69 years of age, suggests that sleep disturbances are predictive of vascular cognitive impairment (Elwood et al., 2010). This is consistent with recent research that suggests a critical role of sleep quality in preserving cognitive function and reducing the risk of dementia (Landry & Liu-Ambrose, 2014). Sleep quality also seems to differ between men and women, with women reporting an increased prevalence of sleep disorders during specific time points, such as menopause (Mallampalli & Carter, 2014), and men demonstrating a greater reduction in slow wave sleep with age (Krishnan, 2006). We are proposing several studies that examine the association between sleep quality and vascular cognitive impairment.  ","The primary aim is to understand the neuropsychological impact of sleep quality in individuals with VCI. Specific aims include the following:  1.	We will explore the relationship between sleep quality and measures of cognition (memory and attention) in VCI as a function of sex.   2.	We will investigate the relationship between sleep quality and quality of life and instrumental activities of daily living","•	Participant demographic information   •	Questionnaires: Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, World Health Organization Quality of Life   •	Neuropsychological test data: Associative memory, WAIS Digit Span, Trail making test, face-name association test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test  •	Neuropsychiatric: Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living   •	Medical Records: history of sleep disorders ","Analyses for each of the aims include:  1.	We will perform a multiple regression with sex, education, age and sleep quality as independent variables and level of cognitive impairment on neuropsychological measures as a dependent variable.   2.	We will perform correlational analyses between sleep quality, quality of life, and instrumental activities of daily living. ","Understanding how sleep quality varies within the VCI group may lead to better clinical assessment and diagnosis (particularly for early-stage disease) and may help with the development of targeted interventions (e.g., sleep interventions)"
OND20161117CH,Chris Hudson,Interobserver agreement amongst expert and trained observers and the Heidelberg Spectralis SD OCT automated segmentation software in eyes with a history of stroke,"There is an urgent need to develop objective, non-invasive and inexpensive methods to assess the severity of neuro-degenerative disease and also to determine how these diseases might respond to treatment. There have been a number of primarily small cross-sectional studies suggesting that retinal thickness assessment might represent an ideal surrogate marker of neuro-degenerative disease, especially in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) is used to non-invasively assess retinal thickness in the ONDRI study cohort at baseline and is repeated at least annually. Assessment of both eyes routinely takes 20 to 40 minutes. Established scan protocols are utilised and image quality evaluations were developed to validate the acquired data.","Methods:  The Heidelberg Spectralis SD-OCT Blue Peak instrument (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) is used to quantify retinal thickness in each subject. Nsite Axonal Analytics Software is used to segment the retinal scans, thereby showing the thickness of each of the retinal sub-layers. The Spectralis utilizes an 870nm center wavelength super luminescent diode to acquire up to 40,000 A-scans/sec with a depth resolution of 7um and a transversal resolution of 14um in the retina. An on-line eye tracking device decreases motion artifacts, while the high scanning speed reduces the impact of involuntary eye movements. Dual beam imaging uses a simultaneously acquired en-face image to accurately locate each A-scan image. A noise reduction algorithm averages multiple B-scans to markedly reduce random noise in the image. Unique alignment software also optimizes image clarity. Overall, narrowing the range of variability using this combination of technologies provides 1 micron smallest measurable change resolution.  Subjects place their head firmly in the head / chin rest. High quality SDOCT scans, achieved by adjustment of the instrument objective lens position in the x, y and z-planes in front of a dilated pupil and by adjustment of the laser / detector intensity controls are acquired. Maximal possible signal strength images, without over exposure, are acquired. To acquire high signal-to-noise images, the cross-sectional images are located in the upper third of the acquisition window and the quality index score (Q) has to be higher than 20.  Two scan protocols are employed: 1. Posterior Pole Scan Protocol, a 30° horizontal x 25° vertical scan, composed of 61 sections (B-scans) with Automatic Real Time (ART) tracking of 9 frames and a central fixation light. 2. RNFL-N Scan Protocol, a 12° circle comprising 1536 A-scans / 16 B-scans in HR-mode with ART tracking of 100 frames and the fixation point in the nasal position so centering the scan on the optic nerve head. Three images for both the macular and optic nerve head scans are acquired in both eyes of subjects at every visit.   Quality control: SD-OCT Scans with a quality (Q) score of less than 20 are excluded from the analysis. Scans that are not properly aligned or not focused are excluded from the study. Every SD-OCT image is visually examined to validate correct application of the segmentation algorithm. Manual correction will be undertaken when appropriate.","retinal volume, thickness, nerve fiber layer thickness",Still formulating this. A grid centered on the fovea will be applied to each SD-OCT image. The grid separates the macula scan into 13 sectors. Mean retinal thickness (±SD) and mean retinal volume (±SD) for each sector will be downloaded from the Spectralis PC and then downloaded into Brain-CODE. Differences between groups in mean retinal thickness and volume at each visit will be assessed. Change in mean retinal thickness and volume will be assessed within each group using 95% confidence limits for change and also using survival analysis.,Achievements and Results:  Established image analysis protocol.  Validated value of manual correction of retinal segmentation of images.  Started main study data analysis
OND20170101DD,Dar Dowlatshahi,VCI Microbleeds,"Cerebral microbleeds (MBs) and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) are remnants of small often occult hemorrhages visualized on blood sensitive MRI sequences such as gradient echo (GRE) or susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). MBs occur in a number of diseases and can be detected incidentally in community-dwelling adults. The pathophysiology of MBs differ across disease states. The majority of MBs are associated with cerebral small vessel diseases (SVD), most notably hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and their associated risk factors (such as age and hypertension). While deep MBs involving the deep grey matter or brainstem are more indicative of hypertensive arteriopathy, strictly lobar MBs are most suggestive of CAA and associated with Alzheimer's Disease. cSS on the other hand is emerging as quite a specific marker for advanced CAA in the elderly.   The clinical significance of MBs and cSS is unclear. Several studies have observed associations between these MRI markers and cognitive dysfunction and gait disturbance. However, the exact dynamics and independent contribution of MBs/cSS to these outcomes are not known. Longitudinal changes in MB/cSS accrual and its relations to progressive cognitive and gait dysfunction are also largely unknown.  We propose a VCI cohort analysis to investigate these concepts, at baseline and longitudinally. We will first assess the prevalence, topography and predictors of MB/cSS in baseline MRIs from the VCI cohort and their relationship with baseline cognitive and gait measures. We will then assess the topography and progression of MB/cSS in the VCI cohort in relation to cognition and gait outcomes.","1.	We hypothesize ApoE genotype, small vessel changes on MRI, and a history of hypertension will independently predict baseline presence of MB/cSS (we do not expect a relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and MB/cSS as the study excluded those with poor glycemic control.)  2.	We hypothesize that patients with MB/cSS will have worse baseline cognition and gait.  3.	We hypothesize the baseline MB/cSS burden and topography, and accrual of MB/cSS over time will predict worsening of cognition and gait.","•	Participant demographic and baseline medical history  •	Imaging: MRI with de novo collection of MB/cSS using established scales (e.g., MARS and Boston Criteria), quantification of other SVD markers such as WMH, enlarged perivascular spaces, and lacunar infarcts, with novel topographical categorization  •	Neuropsychological: Entire minimum dataset  •	Gait: Entire minimum dataset  •	Genetics: Genes associated with increased susceptibility to MB/cSS (ApoE ε4/ε2)","Analyses for each of the aims include:  1. De Novo collection of MB/cSS and SVD markers in the VCI cohort, with ICC against reads from Sean Symons   2. Regression analysis of vascular risk factors, genotype, and small vessel changes as predictors of MB/cSS using a step-wise selection model and adjusting for covariates  3. Regression analysis of MB/cSS burden, topography and progression as predictors of cognitive and gait decline","Our study will seek to support MB/cSS as a biomarker for cognitive decline in patients with vascular cognitive impairment.  Furthermore, this study will attempt to identify those patients at highest risk of decline based on MB/cSS burden and topography. We will attempt to identify potentially modifiable predictors of MB/cSS (risk factors for cerebral small vessel disease) or variables useful for prognosis (ApoE). We request access to clinical data, genomics and MRI (for de novo MB/cSS assessment) in the VCI cohort. Our biomarker of interest (MB/cSS) is not part of the initial ONDRI imaging proposal, and will therefore not overlap with any other analyses. We include Drs. Swartz, Mandzia and McLaughlin (who are also analyzing small vessel disease changes and cognitive outcomes) to ensure there is no overlap with their respective analyses."
OND20170206DBa,Derek Beaton,Vascular cognitive impairment subgroups show distinct aspects of preserved cognition,"The goal of this project is to use multivariate analyses-akin to factor analyses-to identify gene-brain-behavior profiles within the VCI cohort. The goal here would be to identify (1) the most homogenous subgroup, (2) particular subgroups within VCI, (3) unique individuals, and (4) the combination of brain, and behavioral patterns that define subgroups. This is a short-term project that can be done with available data.   I have already performed part of these analyses within the available minimum data sets and have a submission for OHBM 2017 based on the neuropsychological and neuroimaging data.   However, it is likely that some of this will change as data are corrected or updated. However, the analysis pipeline-which includes principal components analysis, partial least squares, and multiple factor analysis-is complete. The data are: all regional (sans global or lateral) estimates, plus left, right, and total hippocampal volume, the neuropsychology data. Within the VCI cohort: Preliminary results show a neuropsychological/neuroimaging gradient from gene non-risk factors to risk factors (e.g., ApoE 3/2 + short C9orf72 repeats to ApoE 4/* + C9orf72 long repeats). On this gradient, those with low gene risk factors show (relatively) high hippocampal volumes, (relatively) high levels of normal appearing grey and white matter, and (relatively) high performance on neuropsychological tests. Genetic risk factors show low neuropsychological performance, and that these are related to high levels of sCSF, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), with specific regions of normal appearing white matter (e.g., R/L temporal and occipital).     Genetics (ApoE) were used only as a post-hoc correlate on the OHBM poster. I will no longer use ApoE","The analyses and aims are data-driven. Broadly, the goals are to identify (1) subgroups within VCI, and (2) what brain-behavioral profiles define these subgroups, and how these profiles relate to risk factors.","Neuroimaging (SABRE LE, full data), Neuropsychology (measures of memory, attention, executive function), and clinical.

OND20170303PR,Pradeep Reddy Raamana,Development of automatic predictive models for early detection of brain disorders and accurate differential diagnosis methods. ,"Despite significant advances in the development of computer-aided diagnostic methods in the last decade, the power and robustness of the derived automatic biomarkers still doesn't meet the clinical needs of today. The availability of large, multi-site and publicly available datasets such as the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) have contributed to the acceleration of, and significant novel insight into the challenges involved in this direction. The lessons learnt from ADNI show that its coverage in number of overlapping diseases as well as the level of quality control employed on the neuroimaging data has not been sufficient in many previous studies. The ONDRI initiative fills this important void by not only broadening the scope of this important study to the required levels (number of modalities, overlapping disorders, time points and harmonized quality control protocols), but is also attempting to elevate the quality of the data.  The aim of this proposal in the long term, when the full ONDRI dataset is available, would be to utilize this unique, well-characterized and high-quality dataset towards the development of not only automatic predictive models for the early detection of individual brain disorders, but also accurate differential diagnosis methods which are necessary in the clinic.","In the short term, with only the baseline VCI data available, I would like to build imaging biomarkers derived from T1 structural MR images to develop discriminative models between VCI and healthy controls drawn from ADNI.","Features I am planning to utilize include but not limited to cortical thickness, gray matter density and subcortical morphometry.",Preprocessing of T1 MR scans through Freesurfer (if not already done),"This analysis is valuable in 1) development of the necessary automatic imaging biomarkers to detect VCI, 2) building the necessary tools to conduct predictive modelling studies necessary for various IDPs across the ONDRI initiative."
OND20170403JRa,Joel Ramirez,A cross-cohort study comparison of imaging and behavioral biomarkers examining the spectrum of cerebrovascular disease: from mild cognitive impairment to Vascular dementia.,"Relative to the milder (nondemented) vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) patients enrolled in ONDRI, the Sunnybrook Dementia Study (SDS) has a group of vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed vascular Alzheimer's disease (AD+VaD) patients. Given the similarities in neuroimaging markers obtained and neuropsychological test batteries acquired, their examination could provide unique insight to the complex and heterogeneous burden of cognitive impairment associated with subclinical brain injury, silent brain infarction, and clinically overt stroke found along the VCI spectrum.","To examine neuroimaging and cognitive biomarkers as they characterize the spectrum of VCI in ONDRI and SDS patients. Hypothesis: independent of stroke volume, executive and memory impairments will map onto brain atrophy in AD+VaD, VaD & VCI with have executive impairments that map onto small vessel disease imaging markers with some brain atrophy, VaD and AD+VaD patients will have signs of hippocampal atrophy, milder VCI patients will have subtle executive impairments that map onto small vessel disease. Perivascular space (PVS) burden will be primarily in the basal ganglia regions of VaD and VCI cases while AD+VaD will show more PVS burden in the centrum semiovale.","Neuroimaging: small vessel disease markers (deep vs. periventricular WMH, lacunes, PVS), global and focal atrophy measures (BPF, ventricular volume, regional WM/GM atrophy, hippocampal volume) Neuropsychology: executive, memory, visuospatial, language","Regression Covariates: age, sex, education, stroke volume, BMI, BP, disease duration (using vascular 'event'/stroke date), vascular risk factors (where available: smoking, diabetes, etc)",AD and VaD are the top two leading causes of dementia sharing common modifiable vascular risk factors that may prevent or delay the onset of cognitive burden found in the elderly with dementia. How different cognitive deficits map onto changes in brain pathology in this spectrum is not well understood.
OND20170403JRb,Joel Ramirez,Associations between MRI-visible perivascular space burden and sleep efficiency in patients with VCI,"Previous work suggests that MRI-visible perivascular spaces (PVS) may indicate poor cerebral glymphatic clearance.1  Moreover, animal models demonstrate that glymphatic clearance occurs primarily during deep sleep,2 with one small retrospective study demonstrating a correlation between PVS burden in the basal ganglia and polysomnography-derived sleep parameters.",Hypothesis: Poor sleep assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) will be correlated with increased PVS burden in the basal ganglia on MRI of patients with Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI). (Also: men will have greater PVS burden compared to women.),"Sleep: PSQI (clinical platform)  Imaging: Total PVS, BG-PVS, WM-PVS (counts & volume), WMH, total intracranial capacity (TIC), cortical stroke volume  Clinical: age, sex, education, BMI, BP","Regression  Covariates: age, sex, education, stroke volume, BMI, systolic BP, atrophy (BPF/vCSF), total WMH, vascular risk factors (smoking, diabetes, etc.)",MRI-visible PVS are a novel emerging biomarker where their presence and anatomical distribution can be used to indicate brain clearance issues relating to hypertensive arteriopathy or cerebral amyloid angiopathy.  Poor sleep quality may have a causal role in the development of protein elimination failure angiopathies and opens the door for sleep and PVS as indicators of drainage impairment and nocturnal metabolite clearance.
OND20170404DB,Derek Beaton,Generalization of the minimum covariance determinant algorithm for categorical and mixed data types ,"Currently, many multivariate outlier/anomaly or robust techniques are fairly limited in their scope and function: most techniques require more observations than variables (n > p) and are limited to strictly continuous data. Only a small number of techniques currently address the former problem and allow for fewer observations than variables (n << p). For example, we currently use minimum covariance determinant (MCD; Rousseeuw & Van Driessen, 1999) and robust principal components analysis (RPCA; Candès et al., 2011).  MCD requires n > p, while RPCA is adapted for n << p. Both techniques require-strictly-continuous data.  Both the MCD and RPCA approaches are either extensions of, or depend on the singular value decomposition (SVD). The SVD has many derivative techniques to allow for analyses of categorical data or even mixed data types, primarily through a technique called 'Correspondence Analysis' (CA; Greenacre, 1984; Beaton et al., 2016).    If we want to apply error and anomaly detection in an effective way for ONDRI (and beyond) we need to have techniques that can handle (1) mixed data types (e.g., categorical and continuous) data across platforms for any arbitrary variable sets.    If we want to apply error and anomaly detection in an effective way for ONDRI (and beyond) we need to have techniques that can handle (1) mixed data types (e.g., categorical and continuous) data across platforms for any arbitrary variable sets, and (2) n << p data in a fashion similar to MCD and RPCA. Eventually these ideas could be combined.","1.	We believe that MCD can be adapted to incorporate CA and allow for outlier detection for data of any size and any type. The generalized MCD technique will be illustrated on a small set of ONDRI data (specifically, the MSAM).  2.	These new techniques will allow investigators within-and beyond-ONDRI to detect outliers in complex multidimensional, mixed data.     The purpose behind developing this technique is that it would eventually replace and/or extend the previous outlier detection methods for ONDRI because it generalizes outlier and anomaly detection in a way that overcomes the drawbacks of all previously mentioned techniques.",Variables for illustrative purposes (pre or post curation or release). Data will likely come from neuropsychology platform for the intended paper that show the formalization of the methods. ,"Develop new techniques that incorporate the features of MCD, RPCA, and/or CA to allow for flexible outlier detection across heterogeneous data types (e.g., continuous, categorical) or high-dimensional data.","These significance statements match the hypotheses addressed above:  1.	The first contribution of this paper is an entirely novel technique for outlier detection.  2. The second contribution of this paper has technical, scientific, and practical applications within and beyond ONDRI and thus we can identify complex (multi-platform) outliers and anomalies (e.g., highly distinct cases). Ensures data quality across ONDRI platforms."
OND20170404KS,Kelly Sunderland,Outlier detection for errors and anomalous values of the initial release in ONDRI,"One of the broadest goals of large-scale and multi-site projects such as ONDRI is to characterize biomarkers of diseases across heterogeneous data. However, in order to characterize these biomarkers we must ensure data integrity and quality. Thus, we propose an outlier detection framework to identify errors and unique individuals within platforms for the ONDRI minimum data sets.","There are two aims in this proposal:   1.	To identify unique individuals through a series of established/previously developed outlier detection methods on the minimum data sets for each platform within ONDRI.  In turn, these lists will be supplied to each platform to check for inputting and processing errors during the data preparation.  To determine whether these unique individuals are: errors that need to be corrected; influential and need to be monitored in subsequent analyses; and/or evidence that support or generate hypotheses.","The minimum data sets across the gait and balance, and neuropsychology platforms, as well as the clinical data to control for possible confounds (ex: age, sex, and education).","A description and brief comparison of three techniques that provide different approaches to detect errors and anomalies:  1.	The MCD algorithm (Rousseeuw & Van Driessen 1999) to identify a robust subset of the data, followed by the Mahalanobis distance to identify participants furthest from the robust subset, and a modified PCA for identifying the variables on which the participants deviate.  2.	The MCD algorithm for PCA to identify a robust subset of the data followed by bootstrapping the participants and projecting the results onto a robust set of principal components. Then, participants outside the bootstrapped thresholds are identified with Mahalanobis and Chi-square distances.  Candès' Robust PCA (Candès, Li, Ma & Wright 2011) identifies a 'good' low rank approximation and a 'bad' sparse approximation, such that they can be added together to recreate the original data matrix. The information in the sparse matrix is typically outlying data and their respective error/anomalous sources.","Outlier detection in the literature is often limited to univariate techniques, with little attention given to multivariate outliers. Further, to our knowledge previous large scale studies (such as ADNI) have not reported on error and anomaly detection. Such error detection is not just critical to ensure ONDRI's data quality and integrity, but provides a roadmap for other large-scale projects.    We will use the minimum data sets of each of the eye tracking, gait and balance, and neuropsychology platforms with particular emphasis on neuropsychology and gait and balance.  This is necessary to identify and subsequently correct any inputting and processing errors prior to analyses and publications on the data. Additionally, through outlier detection, we have (and will continue to) identify highly distinct participants that may require additional inspection.  This ensures data quality across ONDRI platforms."
OND20170614SA,Stephen Arnott,"The Multi-Site, Structure of fMRI for Resting-State fBIRN Phantom Measurements from 3T MRI Scanners in Canada","The developers of the fBIRN phantom within the Biomedical Informatics Network published a number of papers measuring univariate quality assurance (QA) parameters across multiple sites and scanners. These papers were primarily about establishing and justifying the range of QA parameters they produce from the fBIRN phantom processing pipeline. However, to our knowledge there has never been a comprehensive, systematic examination of the utility of these parameters across multiple scanners from all three manufacturers (Siemens, GE, Philips) over 12 or more months worth of measurements. Furthermore, no one has published the multivariate structure of these measurements and the extent to which inter-site effects may be removed using fMRI preprocessing tools. Such an analysis is a necessary first step in establishing the baseline of scanner- and site-dependent variability in fMRI resting state or task measurements.","Significant within- and between-site variability exists in resting state fMRI phantom measurements across Siemens, GE and Philips scanners within ONDRI and CAN-BIND.

This study is necessary but not sufficient to establish the baseline validity of subsequent analyses of resting state and task fMRI data.  It does not utilise any human data sets.

British Columbia providing an additional Philips scanner, and Uni. of Calgary providing an additional GE scanner, together with a full phantom set from Queens. This also recognises CAN-BIND's support of Mojdeh Zamyadi and fBIRN phantom scans at four common sites: Queens, CAMH, TWH/UHN, McMaster.

OND20170824YC,Ying Chen,Behavioural measures from multiple modalities for investigation of decline in processing speed in a VCI cohort ,"Processing speed is a cognitive ability requiring executive functioning as well as basic sensory and motor abilities. Impairment in speed of information processing will reflect neural dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we propose a use of cross-platform behavioural measures from eye-tracking, gait, neuropsychology and clinical platforms to investigate decline in processing speed quantitatively and to identify core speed of processing deficits in patients with VCI.","There are three goals in this proposal:  1) To investigate functional decline in speed of information processing in VCI by employing comprehensive behavioural measures from four platforms in ONDRI (i.e., eye-tracking, gait, neuropsychology and clinical platforms)  2) To examine how these multi-modal forms of measures for processing speed are related to each other, i.e., they all well correlate or are affected differentially in VCI  3) To identify the behavioural measures that will be the most suitable indices reflecting dysfunction of brain regions involved in processing speed in VCI","The variables from the eye-tracking, gait and balance, neuropsychology and clinical platforms will be used for data analysis. In particular, (1) variables from the eye-tracking platform include timing and percentage of express saccades in the pro-saccade task, mean saccade reaction time (SRT) with regular latency in pro- and anti-saccade tasks and intra-subject variability in SRT in both saccade tasks, (2) variables from the gait and balance platform include gait velocity in preferred gait, dual task cost (%) and capacity index (%), (3) variables from the neuropsychology platform include time to complete DKEFs Colour Word Interference Test: colour naming, word reading, inhibition, and inhibition/switch conditions, number of words generated for DKEFs Verbal Fluency Test (letter and category fluency), time to complete Trail-Making Test A&B, and number of items completed for SDMT- coding.

In the literature, single type of behavioural tasks such as saccades or gait is used to predict deficits in processing speed in VCI. To our knowledge, there is no such a study utilizing a wide range of tasks and variables together to investigate the relationships amongst measures from each of multiple modalities, and to identify the measures that will be the best indicators for detecting decline in processing speed in VCI.     Further, a following study focusing on functional-to-structural mapping using neuroimaging techniques including DTI and SD-OCT may be carried out with these results to discover structural changes of relevant neural pathways and/or brain regions. These in turn may be used to track progression as well as to assess current status of VCI patients more accurately.    This approach can also be used to identify deficits and underlying neural dysfunction in each of the four other neurodegenerative diseases and cross these diseases within ONDRI.

OND20170925AA,Agessandro Abrahao Jr.,Pupil Dynamics and Eye Blinks during Saccadic Preparation in Patients with ALS: The Assessment of Cognitive Dysfunction,"Oculomotor abnormalities in ALS have been described, including altered Bell's phenomenon, upward gaze palsy, spasmodic fixation, nystagmus, slowed saccades with saccadic intrusion into smooth pursuit, and square wave jerks. Patients with advanced ALS who chose invasive ventilation in time develop supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, however, the extramotor and cerebral control and degeneration of eye movements in ALS need further characterization.  The anti-saccade task is commonly used to assess the integrity of the oculomotor system and the related frontal executive function. In this task, subjects are instructed, prior to stimulus appearance, to either look at the peripheral stimulus (pro-saccade) or to suppress the automatic response and voluntarily look in the opposite direction from the stimulus (anti-saccade). Anti-saccade performance was previously shown to be particularly impaired in ALS patients.  Our team recently observed that the pupil size prior to stimulus appearance in pro-saccade and anti-saccade tasks can predict subsequent saccadic behaviors.  The pupil size is modulated by an active preparation set for successful voluntary pro-saccade and anti-saccade tasks and involves connections with the superior colliculus and frontal eye field in the frontal lobes. Pupil size was larger in preparation for correct anti-saccades as compared to correct pro-saccades and erroneous pro-saccades made in the anti-saccade condition.   Although the anti-saccade performance appears to be abnormal in ALS, the pupillary responses in saccade preparation are largely unknown in patients with ALS. ","In this study, we aim to exam the profile of pupil dynamics and eye blinks in patients with ALS and compare them to healthy controls and patients with FTD, during saccade preparation (i.e., prior to the execution of pro-saccades and anti-saccades).  Secondary aims include the correlation of saccades, pupil responses, and eye blinks with motor and cognitive deficits in ALS (and FTD) subjects.","- Demographics of patients with ALS and FTD enrolled in ONDRI study  - Revised ALS Functional rating Scale (ALSFRS-R)  - Cognitive tasks of patients with ALS and FTD (MoCA and Neuropsychology which include visuospatial, executive function, attention/working memory, language, and memory)  -  Saccade responses, pupil dynamics, and eye blink rate in pro-saccade and anti-saccade tasks in patients with ALS compared to healthy controls (Healthy control group data from Dr. Munoz's laboratory) and patients with FTD  -  Brain imaging (DTI and Flair)  - Visits: Baseline","Using MoCA, the ALS cohort will be divided into those with and without cognitive impairment. Among the four groups of age-matched control, ALS without cognitive impairment, ALS with cognitive impairment, and FTD, we will compare saccadic behaviour (Count and SRT), pupil dynamics, eyeblinks, and the neuropsychology domains. We will also perform correlation and regression analysis of independent variables such as age, gender, disease duration, site of onset, ALSFRS-R decline rate, ALS clinical severity, cognitive domains, pupil dynamics, and eye blinks.  ","To our best knowledge, this will be the first study on pupil dynamics in saccade preparation in patients with ALS which will improve our understanding of extramotor involvement in ALS and may serve as a candidate biomarker of cognitive impairment."
OND20170925AK,Arunima Kapoor,Impact of White Matter Hyper-intensities on Functional Outcome After Stroke,"White matter hyperintensities are a common neuroimaging finding in stroke patients and may partially be responsible for the relationship between age and post-stroke functional outcome (Arsana et al., 2009). However, the impact of white matter hyperintensity burden on functional outcome remains controversial, long-term studies are scarce and whether leukoaraiosis explains the relationship between age and outcome is under-studied. A preliminary analysis of a small post-stroke cohort showed that when included in a multivariate model with severe white matter burden (Fazekas score 3), age was no longer a significant predictor of functional outcome. Stroke severity and severe white matter burden were the only significant predictors of long-term functional outcome after stroke. We found that white matter burden explained the same amount of variance in functional outcome as stroke severity, and that white matter burden may continue to influence basic activities of daily living even years after stroke.  We would like to determine if these findings are valid a larger sample with white matter hyperintensities, using volumes as opposed to visual rating scales. Further, if we have sufficient variation in mRS scores in the cohort, we will aim to run a mediation analysis to explore whether the effect of age on functional outcome is mediated by white matter burden.","Aims  • To explore whether white matter hyperintensities burden mediates the relationship between age and functional outcome  • To evaluate whether white matter hyperintensities burden is a significant independent predictor of functional outcome after stroke    Anticipated Results  	We predict that white matter burden will mediate the relationship between age and functional outcome, such that greater age is associated with worse functional outcome partially due to greater white matter hyperintensity burden.   ","Dependent variable: Baseline mRS  Independent variables: Age, sex, education, cortical/subcortical infarct volume, white matter hyperintensity volume  Subjects:  ONDRI VCI patients with confirmed stroke and mRS completed at baseline.  ","We will be running a linear regression model and if we have sufficient variation in mRS scores in the cohort, we will aim to run a mediation analysis to explore whether the effect of age on functional outcome is mediated by white matter burden.","Unlike age‒which is a non-modifiable factor‒the progression of white matter hyperintensities could potentially be decreased by managing cardiovascular risk factors (Schwartz et al., 2005). Delayed development or progression of leukoaraiosis may not only decrease stroke occurrence, post-stroke mortality and cognitive decline but may also limit functional deficits after a stroke. "
OND20170925EE,Allison A. Dilliott,Investigating associations between APOE genotypes and neurodegenerative disease phenotypes,"ApoE exists in three isoforms-E2, E3, E4. The isoforms are encoded by the APOE gene, leading to six genotypes (E2/2; E3/2; E3/3; E4/2; E4/3; E4/4) based on combinations of alleles at C526T and T388C. The APOE E4 allele increases risk for AD/MCI. Its protein product does not efficiently clear amyloid ß (Aß) from the brain, accelerating Aß aggregate formation and contributing to neurodegeneration. ",Our study aims to compare genotype and allele frequencies of APOE E4 and E4/E4 between the ONDRI cohorts and each cohort with normal controls. We hypothesized that the APOE E4 allele will be associated with AD/MCI. ,"Individual APOE genotypes at C526 and T388 determined using ONDRISeq for 519 ONDRI patients and TaqMan® allelic discrimination assays for 110 cognitively normal controls collected from the Blackburn Cardiovascular Genetics Lab, APOE E4 allele frequency, APOE E4/E4 genotype frequency.","Logistic regression adjusting for age and sex to obtain odds ratios for the APOE E4 allele, E4/4 genotype, and E2 allele for each disease cohort.","Association between APOE E4 and E4/E4 and AD/MCI is already well-established. One purpose of APOE genotyping in this project is to validate our ONDRI cohorts. We saw the expected association between APOE E4 and E4/E4 and AD/MCI and not with other cohorts, which provides validation of the ONDRI diagnoses. Determining associations between specific genotypes and neurodegenerative disease phenotypes could aid in deciding which genetic test may be relevant in estimating disease risk. APOE genotypes of each patient could be compared to data from other platforms to look for any associations between predicted disease-contributing genotypes and specific phenotypic presentations."

OND20170927JRa,Joel Ramirez,"The relationship between focal gray matter atrophy and imaging markers of cerebrovascular disease in vascular cognitive impairment: cortical thinning, stroke volume, and white matter hyperintensities.","Previous work has identified an Alzheimer's disease (AD) bio-signature based around cortical thinning in 9 specific regions of interest. These markers may also be modulated by exposure to the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 genotype. The ONDRI VCI cohort provides an opportunity to explore the potential for similar characterization of regional cortical thinning in the presence of stroke and small vessel disease pathology in both AD and VCI.  Unfortunately, cortical thickness mapping using the widely used FreeSurfer software has ~24% failure rates when applied to an elderly samples with mild cognitive impairment, potentially due to the presence of focal atrophy and cerebrovascular disease.","1. To test and validate a novel method which enables FreeSurfer to account for focal atrophy, stroke, and cerebrovascular disease (measured by white matter hyperintensities, WMH) using ONDRI's structural imaging pipeline (SABRE-LE).

To implement this method on the ONDRI VCI stroke patients and evaluate the results.

OND20170927JRb,Joel Ramirez,Automatic sub-segmentation for stroke core and penumbra volumes in vascular cognitive impairment.,"Currently, there no robust and reliable, fully automated cortical stroke quantification methods that can segment the necrotic infarct core from the surrounding ischemic penumbra.  The stroke penumbra is of particular importance as it represents brain tissue that may be recoverable and its volume relative to the infarcted core may be a sensitive indicator for stroke patients that are good candidates for post-stroke rehabilitation therapies.  In ONDRI's neuroimaging pipeline, the entire stroke has been manually traced without separation for core and penumbra.

Hypothesis: A dissociation will be observed between the core and stroke penumbra, where each will correlate with different cognitive domains, penumbra will be associated with speed of processing. Exploratory: core-penumbra ratio will yield novel insights to cognitive associations.  ","Given that there is huge variability in the extent of damage affecting stroke survivors, it is important for us to acquire a deeper understanding of the differences observed in large vessel ischemic strokes.  ONDRI's multimodal imaging provides a unique opportunity for us to study the differences between the stroke core and penumbra and how each component differentially affects cognition. Imaging methods that can effectively isolate the penumbra from the core may guide future interventions that target the penumbra for reperfusion.    Future work will examine how stroke core and penumbra differentially affects gait and behavioral outcomes.  As this basic methodological study will be a proof-of-concept cross-sectional ONDRI study of baseline VCI patients, the reasonable extension of this work will examine how these imaging measures can be used to predict stroke survivor outcomes longitudinally.

Since the Farhan publication, enrolment has closed and data curators have been working to clean the cross-sectional baseline data and prepare them for analysis.  The characteristics of the sample collected will be imperative for these analyses, and important for understanding/generalizing the results and making impactful conclusions.  We want to provide a reference that summarizes the participant characteristics at baseline in a single document.  In addition, we want to describe the recruitment process and know this may have influenced these characteristics.    Finally, there are many complexities of the data that will be important to consider and potentially account for when analysing the data.  We want to provide a resource for researchers that details the data structure so that researchers may make informed decisions when handling the data.

OND20171118SH,Seyyed Mohammad Hassan Haddad,The ONDRI Diffusion Tensor Imaging Pipeline (ONDRI-DTIP): Performance Evaluation of Three Automatic Quality Control Processing Pipelines for Multi-scanner Diffusion Weighted Brain Images,"Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a sensitive and relatively specific magnetic resonance (MR) modality used clinically to detect ischemic lesions within minutes after the onset of stroke damage. Hence, its use increases in the standard diagnosis and management procedures of acute stroke cases. According to longitudinal studies involving stroke patients, at least two weeks after the incidence of stroke, the lesions are still detectable in brain diffusion weighted images caused by changes in water diffusivity as well as T2 effects. In addition, changes in tissue microstructure, in particular related to white matter integrity, modify water diffusion and are detectable by DWI. Therefore, the utility of DWI is not limited to acute stroke cases. In this research we further investigate the alteration of water diffusion patterns and specifically diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scalar parameters within different types of ischemic lesions in people with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). To this end, three fully automatic pipelines were developed for quality control, artifacts removal, and processing of the multisite/multi-scanner ONDRI DWI data and will be compared to investigate DTI scalar changes within diverse types of cerebral tissues and ischemic injuries.","In this research study we follow two specific aims:  1. To develop three comprehensive fully automatic pipelines for quality control, artifacts removal, and processing of the multisite/multi-scanner ONDRI DWI data. These pipelines will be developed based on a combination of recent DWI quality control algorithms and well-known artifact removal and processing pipelines available in the literature consistent with the Enigma framework. These pipelines must also be effective for both region-based and tract-based statistical analysis to quantitatively detect DTI scalar parameter changes within different brain regions particularly within the various types of cerebral tissues and ischemic lesions.  2. To choose the superlative pipeline with the highest accuracy and sensitivity in discriminating diverse cerebral tissues and ischemic abnormalities. This will be called the ONDRI Diffusion Tensor Imaging Pipeline (ONDRI-DTIP) and will be utilized for the analysis of the multisite/multi-scanner ONDRI DTI data.",1.

It is noteworthy that these regions will be segmented by the Imaging Platform team at Sunnybrook.  2.	Mean, STD, coefficient of variations (CV), or other relevant statistical parameters of different DTI scalars (FA and MD) within the abovementioned different cerebral tissues and ischemic lesions will be calculated.  3.

OND20171121AT,Angie Troyer,Assessing Vascular Cognitive Impairment with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment,"The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been found to be generally sensitive to post-stroke cognitive impairment (Koski, 2013 for a review). Content validity evidence suggest that the MoCA covers most of the domains that represent cognitive impairment in cerebrovascular disease; visuospatial and executive functions (Koski et al 2013, Boci et al  2013), and is more sensitive to mild cognitive deficits compared to the MMSE.  However, a recent study found that the MoCA administered within 3 months post-stroke did not detect 78% of patients who showed impairment on neuropsychological assessment in at least one cognitive domain (Chan et al., 2014). This suggests that the MoCA may be sensitive at detecting global cognitive impairment, but less sensitive at detecting impairment within specific domains. In particular, impairment was detected in the domains of general intelligence, information processing speed, and visual memory which are areas not assessed by the MoCA. We propose an extension of this study by examining stroke patients in the non-acute stage (> 3 months) from the ONDRI vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) cohort. We will compare neuropsychological assessment scores between those showing MoCA scores that are intact (i.e., >25; N=86) vs. impaired (i.e., 18-25; N=67). ","The study aim is to compare VCI patients with high vs. low MoCA scores to determine how the MoCA score for post-stroke patients compares to a more extensive neuropsychological battery in post-stroke patients with and without cognitive impairment. Specifically, we will:  1.	Determine the sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA (at various cut-off points) in identifying cognitive impairment as measured with a full neuropsychology battery; and determine whether more detailed MoCA scoring and/or additional screening measures improve the sensitivity/specificity of identifying cognitive impairment  2.	Examine whether the two groups (high vs. low MoCA) differ on the cognitive domains that are assessed by the MoCA (i.e., executive functioning, visuospatial, verbal memory, naming) versus not assessed by the MoCA (i.e., general intelligence, information processing speed, visual memory)  3.	Identify whether any demographic or stroke characteristics relate to differences on the MoCA and neuropsychological assessment scores ","•	VCI participant demographic (e.g., age, sex, past/previous occupation) and clinical information (e.g., date of last stroke, location of stroke, MoCA scores)   •	Neuropsychological test data from the following domains: IQ, attention/working memory/processing speed, complex attention/executive, memory, metacognition/functional  ","1.	ANOVAs to compare the high vs. low MoCA groups on the specified domains  2.	ANOVAs to compare the high vs. low MoCA groups on demographic and stroke characteristics  Correlations of test scores with demographic and stroke characteristics",This study would capitalize on the design of ONDRI in which both MoCA and neuropsychological assessment scores are available for patients who had a stroke more than 3 months ago. Implications of the study include identification of those who show specific cognitive impairment that may not be detected by global screening assessments like the MoCA. It could also help further define the neuropsychological profile of vascular cognitive impairment patients and better understand accuracy and limitations of MoCA in VCI.  This study may help identify other neuropsychological measures that could be administered alongside the MoCA to further strengthen the ability to detect post-stroke impairments in specific domains. Identification of these patients is important to inform appropriate rehabilitation.
OND20171205GM,Graham McCreath,Kidney function and post-stroke cognitive impairment,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and long-term loss of kidney function primarily caused by hypertension and diabetes. Already an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and dementia, accumulating evidence suggests that CKD can independently predict the presence and severity of cerebral small vessel disease, possibly due to shared anatomic and vasoregulatory features of the brain and kidneys (Makin et al., 2015). CKD has been consistently associated with poorer cognitive function in individuals without previous stroke, partly via the high prevalence of cerebral small vessel disease (Toyoda, 2015). In contrast, only two studies to date (conducted with Japanese and Israeli populations, respectively) have explored the effect of CKD on post-stroke cognition (Auriel et al., 2016; Yamamoto et al., 2011). The ONDRI dataset presents a unique and important opportunity to examine the interrelation of CKD, markers of cerebral small vessel disease, and post-stroke cognitive impairment in a Canadian sample. Expanding on past studies, the proposed study will include a more detailed neuropsychological evaluation and will also examine interactions with ApoE4 status.","In the VCI cohort, CKD will be identified on the basis of serum creatinine concentration, which is included in the ONDRI lab assessment. Associations between CKD severity, cognitive performance, and radiological markers of cerebral small vessel disease (i.e., atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, and microbleeds) will then be examined. We expect CKD severity to be associated with greater cerebral small vessel disease burden and worse cognitive performance, particularly in domains most susceptible to small vessel pathology, such as processing speed and executive functions.","-Clinical variables, including demographic data (age, sex, years of education, ethnicity), medical/surgical history (time since index stroke, infarct size & location, CVD diagnostic history), concomitant medications (use of antihypertensive or antihyperglycemic medication), vital signs, weight and height, complete blood count results (creatinine, lipid profile, glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin), smoking history, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS)  -Genomic data (ApoE4 allele status only)  -Neuropsychology  -Neuroimaging (T1-weighted, PD/T2-weighted, gradient echo, and FLAIR sequences only)  ","Associations between CKD severity, cognitive performance, and features of small vessel pathology will be tested for using three sets of regression models. In the first model, unadjusted regression coefficients for CKD status will be calculated. Model 2 will account for age, sex, and education. Model 3 will further adjust for cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking status, and diabetes. Mediation analyses will be used to assess the causal role of small vessel disease features in the pathway connecting CKD severity to cognitive impairment. Finally, interactions between CKD severity and ApoE4 status in predicting cognitive outcomes will be explored.","There is a strong need to identify factors beyond age and stroke severity that predict an individual's conversion from cognitively intact to cognitively impaired following stroke. The proposed study will investigate CKD, a potentially modifiable factor, which, if aggressively managed, might help maintain cognitive status and quality of life following stroke. The proposed study will also examine the utility of kidney function as a proxy for cerebral small vessel disease burden."

OND20180105PM,Paula McLaughlin,The Utility of the MoCA across PD-MCI Subtypes,"The Montreal-Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening tool shown to have high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (87%) for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) when using a suggested cut-off score of 26 (Nasreddine et al., 2005). Although the MoCA was originally designed to detect early cognitive difficulties in individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, this task is currently used across many clinical populations and in a variety of settings. In relation to Parkinson's disease (PD), the MoCA has previously been shown to be effective at detecting MCI and at predicting cognitive decline (e.g., Kandiah et al., 2014). However, little is known about the sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA at detecting cognitive impairment across PD-MCI subtypes. As the PD-MCI subtypes are associated with unique clinical features (Goldman & Litvan, 2011) and have distinct trajectories of cognitive decline (Janvin et al., 2006), it is important to determine the utility of the MoCA as a cognitive screening tool across these PD subgroups.",The main objective is to determine the utility of the MoCA at detecting cognitive impairment across PD-MCI subtypes against a MDS Task Force - Level II Neuropsychological Assessment. Study will also explore the use of multiple MoCA cut-off scores to optimize utility of tool.,"Clinical Platform: MoCA (total, item responses), participant demographics, disease-specific history, medications, MDS-UPDRS, Modified Hoehn And Yahr, SCOPA-AUT, FOG-Q, Schwab And England (ADL).    Neuropsychology Platform Data: Minimum Dataset (including iADLs, ADLs measures); Short-IQ CODE-self and other (subjective cognitive change).  ",Descriptive statistics; Classification (sensitivity and specificity) analyses of the MoCA.,"Identifying appropriate MoCA cut-offs across PD-MCI subtypes has important clinical utility, and could potentially impact how care is delivered in the clinic (i.e., identifying individuals who need to be followed more closely, or be referred for a full cognitive workup)."
OND20180108AK,Arunima Kapoor,Utility of MRI in the assessment of AD/MCI - findings from ONDRI study.,"Current diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) specifically do not recommend magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnostic workup since universally accepted quantitative biomarkers have not been established.  They refer to the presence of 'multiple or extensive infarcts or severe white matter hyperintensity burden' as exclusions, but without requiring MRI may be missing smaller amounts of vascular disease or other pathologies that could impact disease expression and progression. Current guidelines do not support routine MRI use and patients are therefore often diagnosed with MCI or AD using routine clinical history, cognitive testing and, frequently, CT scans. MRI can serve an important role in the diagnosis of AD or MCI by identifying comorbid pathologies that may alter treatment or prognosis. Subtle vascular disease (lacunar small vessel disease, small cortical infarcts, diffuse white matter changes) may impact presentation, and will have significant treatment implications (e.g. detection and treatment of vascular risk factors) that could alter long-term outcomes. Additionally, clinical trials in AD/MCI that use the McKhann criteria may not use MRI to exclude vascular disease, thus increasing heterogeneity within trials. This is a key consideration given the negative results of treatment trials.","AIMS: To determine 1) the frequency with which inclusion of clinical review of MRI results detects comorbid vascular and non-vascular pathologies that could impact clinical management or alter findings from clinical trials and 2) whether those with and without incidental findings have different degrees of cognitive impairment or brain atrophy.  HYPOTHESES:  In our cohort of participants screened in specialty geriatrics and memory clinics with thorough clinical assessments according to current diagnostic criteria, 1) there will be >5% of people with potentially important comorbid findings detected on MRI and 2) those with and without comorbid findings (vascular or non-vascular) will differ on measures of cognition, function or medial temporal / hippocampal atrophy.","1)	Study sample will include all ONDRI screened/consented patients who met diagnostic criteria for AD and MCI and completed an MRI scan.   2)	Patients with incidental findings will be identified.   3)	Demographic, neuropsychological and focal brain volume measures from patients with and without incidental findings    Dependent variables: % of AD/MCI patients with incidental MRI findings; age, sex, education differences between patients with and without incidental findings; neuropsychological, function and focal brain volume differences between patients with and without incidental findings    Independent variable: Incidental MRI finding","Proposed Analyses:  % = patients who met AD or MCI criteria and had incidental MRI findings/all patients who met AD/MCI diagnostic criteria       Differences in demographic, neuropsychological, functional and medial temporal/hippocampal brain volume measures between those with and without incidental findings will be examined using t-tests.",The current absence of magnetic resonance imaging results in the diagnosis criteria of AD/MCI limits detection of alternate or comorbid conditions that could influence management of AD/MCI as well as comorbid conditions. The results of this analysis could impact current diagnostic guidelines by highlighting the value of qualitative consideration of magnetic resonance imaging results in disease diagnosis and management.
OND20180117AD,Allison A. Dilliott,Association of APOE E4 with processing speed in individuals with vascular cognitive impairment.,"Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is characterized by cognitive decline resulting from stroke or cerebrovascular accident (Sun et al. Ann Transl Med. 2014). It is the second most common form of dementia, following Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Frances et al. World J Psychiatr. 2016). One of the most accepted genetic risk factors for AD is common variation in the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE); however, data are controversial regarding the association of this risk factor with the development of VCI (Skrobot et al. J Alzheimers Dis. 2016; Chai et al. J Alzheimers Dis. 2016; Baum et al. J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol. 2007).   As a part of the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI), all participants are screened for common variants in APOE, with particular interest in the risk alleles rs429358(CT) and rs7412(CT). These allele combinations allow for the determination of the APOE genotype, of which the E4/4 genotype is the strongest known risk factor for late-onset AD. In fact, even a single E4 allele has been associated with an elevated risk of AD (Saunders et al. Neurology. 1993). Further, presence of the E4 allele has been seen to decrease the processing speed of cognitively normal individuals (Luo et al. Brain Imaging Behav. 2016; Ready et al. Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen. 2011; O'Hara et al. J Am Geriatr Soc. 1998). However. the association with processing speed in individuals with AD is uncertain (van der Vlies et al. Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord. 2007; Morgen et al. Alzheimers Dement. 2014). Importantly, the studies have only obtained processing speed measures from a limited number of variables, most commonly by neuropsychology tests of executive functioning (Ready et al. Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen. 2011; van der Vlies et al. Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord. 2007).  While there is no consensus on whether the E4 allele increases risk of VCI, the effect of this risk allele on the processing speed of individuals with VCI has yet to be researched.   Previous analyses are planned to examine the functional parameters that can be used to assess an individual's processing speed (Chen et al., ONDRI publication proposal) and investigate the parameters' relationships with structural measures (Leontieva et al. ONDRI publication proposal). The functional parameters will be assessed with neuropsychological batteries, gait performance tasks, and eye tracking. Structural measures will include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT). In this paper, we will determine whether these parameters and measures are associated with the APOE E4 allele within the ONDRI VCI cohort, therefore indicating a possibility of APOE E4 being a driving risk factor for impaired processing speed.  ","We aim to investigate the relationship between APOE E4 and functional parameters (cognition, gait, eye movements) and structural measures (MRI, SD-OCT) in participants with vascular cognitive impairment.","Genomics:  APOE genotyping  Clinical:   Age, gender, ethnicity, education, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, body-mass index (BMI), smoking, medications, time between stroke and assessment  Neuropsychology:  Scaled scores for Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFs) Colour Word Interference Test: colour naming, word reading, inhibition, and inhibition/switch conditions, scaled scores for DKEFs Verbal Fluency Test, letter and category fluency, z-scores for Trail-Making Test A&B, z-score for Symbol Digit Modalities Test- coding  Gait:  Velocity (m/s) in preferred gait, dual task cost (%) serial 1, dual task cost (%) animal naming, dual task cost (%) serial 7, Capacity index (%).

","Multivariate regression will be used to analyze the association between APOE E4 carrier status and the functional parameter and structural measure, including covariates such as age; sex; education level; and among others that may be affecting processing speed. ","Identifying associations between APOE E4 and functional processing speed deficits across multiple platforms and testing modalities will add confidence to the previous evidence of the risk allele's effect on cognitive processing. It will also be the first evaluation of these associations in individuals with VCI. Further, identifying associations between the E4 allele and structural measures that have also shown a relationship with the functional processing speed parameters could indicate that APOE is the driving risk factor in the disturbed neuronal circuit in VCI. This investigation will further our understanding of the effect of APOE in individuals who have experienced stroke; a positive finding will allow the E4 carrier status of an individual to possibly serve as a biomarker for disease progression."
OND20180123JR,Joel Ramirez,MRI-visible perivascular spaces in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases,"Previous work suggests that the presence of isolated MRI-visible perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia (BG-PVS), also known as 'Virchow-Robin' spaces, may be associated with different disease subtypes in Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, recent studies suggest that MRI-visible PVS may indicate poor cerebral glymphatic clearance, a process that clears waste products such as amyloid-beta from the brain in a sleep-dependant manner. Although not fully described in PD, recent studies have also demonstrated that BG-PVS burden is higher in vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) (likely due to hypertensive arteriopathy), while white matter PVS (WM-PVS) burden tends to be higher in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (possibly due to comorbid cerebral amyloid angiopathy and small vessel disease).     ","Aim 1. To determine if PVS burden is associated with particular PD clinical characteristics   Hypothesis: PD patients with high PVS burden are more likely to exhibit problems in some or all of the following domains: motor function, cognition, gait (including freezing and falls), depression, anxiety, psychiatric symptoms, autonomic function and quality of life.     Aim 2. To examine relationships between sleep quality in PD patients with BG- and WM-PVS  Hypothesis: a) Poor sleep assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is independently associated with increased BG-PVS burden. (b) Increased WM-PVS are found in PD patients that carry the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (APOE E4), which may suggest comorbid amyloid pathology.    Pending ONDRI VCI and MCI/AD data release:  Aim 3. To examine differences in PVS burden between PD, AD and VCI   Hypothesis: PD will have the lowest PVS burden overall, AD will have greater WM-PVS burden, and VCI will have higher BG-PVS burden and higher PVS burden overall.    Pending ONDRI follow-up data release:  Aim 4. To examine cognitive changes in PD patients with and without PVS burden   Hypothesis: PD patients with higher PVS are at greater risk of cognitive decline and incident dementia. Baseline cross-sectional analysis will show that PVS are associated with poor visuospatial processing.    Note: Statistical power and PD spectrum representation may be increased depending on availability of additional PD data from other publicly available datasets (or internally available datasets with via UHN).","Structural Neuroimaging: PVS counts & volume, BPF, ST-TIV.12,13  Clinical: Basic demographics, PSQI, PD medications, MDS-UPDRS, QIDS, GAD-7, MoCA, H&Y, PDQ-39 (QoL), FOG-Q, Falls assessment, S&E, NPI-Q, Brief symptom inventory  Genomics: APOE-E4 status  Neuropsychology: Derived from principle component analysis corresponding to the following functions: speed, memory, language, simple attention, object perception, visuospatial processing.",1. Correlations  2. Linear regression  3. ANOVA for group differences  ,"MRI-visible PVS may be a useful biomarker to inform clinicians regarding disease subtype in PD patients, as well as potentially predict future cognitive decline.  Moreover, PVS differences in anatomical distribution and associations with APOE E4 between PD, VCI, and AD/MCI may indicate issues relating to comorbid hypertensive arteriopathy and/or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Poor sleep quality may have a causal role in the development of protein elimination failure and opens the door for sleep and PVS as indicators of drainage impairment and nocturnal clearance of toxic metabolites such as amyloid-beta. ONDRI's comprehensive neuroimaging and clinical data allows us to assess how sleep and brain health are related in PD.  This work will have a significant impact on Ontarians as it will help guide clinical health targets for PD therapeutics to help reduce the impact of dementia related to Parkinson's disease."
OND20180124DB,Derek Beaton,Robust outlier detection for low and high dimensional neuroimaging data with principal components analysis and split-half resampling.,"Currently, many multivariate outlier/anomaly or robust techniques are fairly limited in their scope and function: most techniques require more observations than variables (n > p) and are limited to strictly continuous data. Only a small number of techniques currently address the former problem and allow for fewer observations than variables (n << p). For example, we currently use minimum covariance determinant (MCD; Rousseeuw & Van Driessen, 1999) and robust principal components analysis (RPCA; Candès et al., 2011).  MCD requires n > p, while RPCA is best used when  n << p. Both the MCD and RPCA approaches are either extensions of, or depend on the singular value decomposition (SVD).     Our goal is to create a technique adapted for data of any size (i.e., n > p or n << p). We propose to do so with principal components analysis (PCA) and split-half resampling (SHR). This novel framework allows for detection of outliers and robust estimates (in a low dimensional subspace). ","1.	We believe a more flexible framework than most of the current outlier detection frameworks can be established through PCA and SHR.  2.	This new technique will allow investigators within-and beyond-ONDRI to detect outliers in datasets of any size.     The purpose behind developing this technique is that it would eventually replace and/or extend the previous outlier detection methods for ONDRI because it generalizes outlier and anomaly detection in a way that overcomes the drawbacks of all previously mentioned techniques.",Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and SABRE-LE data for the ADMCI and VCI groups. Possible clinical variables would be strictly limited to demographics. ,Develop a new technique to supplement and/or replace existing outlier techniques and robust inference methods.,"To ensure high quality data and inference we require methods that can identify outliers and/or make robust estimates but very few such techniques exist. Outliers are particularly problematic in ONDRI (and similar studies) where sample sizes are a fraction of the number of variables (e.g., resting state of a single cohort)."
OND20180125YC,Ying Chen,Lateralization effect of cortical strokes on saccade performance in the VCI cohort,"Pro- and anti-saccade tasks have become a popular research tool to assess sensory, motor and cognitive functions in neurodegenerative diseases. Different brain areas in the saccadic control circuitry are involved in the two types of tasks. Briefly, occipital and parietal cortices control pro-saccades, in contrast anti-saccades recruit frontal cortex. A contralateral control of saccadic movements is observed in some cortical regions, such as frontal eye field. However, how each of those cortical areas in the saccadic control circuit plays its role (having a contralateral or ipsilateral effect), and whether there are other cortical areas beyond the circuitry that also contribute to saccade control is still unknown. In VCI patients cortical infarcts at discrete locations have been observed. We propose this study to investigate whether there is lateralization effect on saccade performance, i.e., whether cortical stroke identified in a cortical region in one hemisphere, for example in left frontal cortex, will results impaired performance in saccades made to the opposite direction of the stroke location, in this case, increased saccadic reaction time for rightward saccades.","According to the parcellated 26 cortical regions, 13 in each hemisphere, from the structural MRI data using the SABRE (Semi-Automated Brain Region Extraction) technique,  1) First, we will categorize the VCI cohort into 6 groups, each of which includes patients with cortical strokes in one of the six cortices, i.e., left or right frontal, parietal and occipital cortex.   - We hypothesize that the groups with occipital strokes will have lateralization effect on saccade reaction time (SRT: the time from target onset to the first saccade), but not on direction error in both pro- and anti-saccade tasks.   - We hypothesize that the groups with parietal strokes will have lateralization effect on SRT in both tasks and maybe on direction error in the anti-saccade task, but not in the pro-saccade task.  - We hypothesize that the groups with frontal strokes will have lateralization effect on SRT and direction error in the anti-saccade task, but not in the pro-saccade task.   2) Second, we will further divide each of the parietal and frontal stroke groups into 2 sub-parietal groups, and 6 sub-frontal groups, and then find Talairach coordinates of those ROIs being the major parts of the neural circuitry controlling saccadic eye movements. In particular, there are four regions on each side of the parietal and frontal cortex, i.e., parietal eye field (PEF), frontal eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF) and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).  - We hypothesize that the groups with cortical infarcts in DLPFC will have lateralization effect on express direction error in the anti-saccade task.  - We hypothesize that the groups with cortical infarcts in FEF or SEF may have lateralization effect on regular direction error and SRT in the anti-saccade task.  - We hypothesize that the groups with cortical infarcts in PEF will have lateralization effect on regular direction error in the anti-saccade task and on SRT in both tasks.","Delta values (difference between right and left saccades) on saccade parameters are analyzed based on the location of cortical infarcts in VCI patients from structural MRI data. In particular, the variables include  1) Viable direction error rate on pro- and anti-saccades  2) Express and regular direction error rate on anti-saccades  3) Viable SRT on pro- and anti-saccades  4) Express and regular SRT on anti-saccades  5) Variability in SRT on pro- and anti-saccades  In addition, variables from the clinical platform: age, sex, education, stroke history",1) perform Wilcoxon signed-rank test between VCI patients and age-matched controls 2) using log-linear (Poisson) for variables 1 and 2 as outcomes 3) using general linear model for variables 3-5 as outcomes.,"By doing the delta analysis on these saccade parameters for VCI patients who have cortical strokes at a specified location, the dysfunction of that specific cortical region in the saccadic neural network will be discovered. Further, the neural mechanism of how those cortical regions contribute to the saccade control, i.e., an ipsilateral or contralateral effect, will be implicated."
OND20180227CF,Carina Fan,Individual differences in autobiographical memory and function in dementia,"We will investigate how individual differences in memory abilities relate to daily function in patients with age-related memory deficits. Autobiographical memory (AM) involves remembering information relevant to one's own life, including both personally experienced events (episodic memory) and personal factual knowledge (semantic memory). AM ability may be characterized as a continuum on which individuals vary at the trait level, analogous to personality or intelligence. At the extremes, individuals with highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM) can richly and accurately recall almost all personal past events, whereas those with severely deficient autobiographical memory (SDAM) are unable to recall details from past experiences despite normal learning and memory for factual (i.e., semantic) information. Episodic memory is one of the first domains to decline in aging and in Alzheimer's disease, but little is known about the factors contributing to inter-individual variability in cognitive aging trajectories. We suggest that individual differences in AM abilities may play a role in determining functional outcomes in patients with Alzheimer's disease. ","We hypothesize that having low episodic AM abilities throughout life might actually confer an advantage in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Individuals with SDAM can be healthy and function normally in day-to-day life and on traditional memory tests, as long as these tasks can be accomplished with non-episodic memory processes. This suggests that those with SDAM have developed alternative strategies to navigate daily life with limited access to episodic details; as such, they may experience less functional impairment after the onset of MCI or Alzheimer's, compared to individuals who must newly adjust to age- or disease-related decreases in episodic memory abilities. ","The mini Survey of Autobiographical Memory (SAM) will be our primary measure of AM ability. This questionnaire assesses self-reported episodic autobiographical, semantic, and spatial memory, as well as future prospection. We will use all of the neuropsychological measures to form a composite of neuropsychological functioning in Alzheimer's and MCI patients. In addition, we will use the SABRE-LE 3D T1-weighted structural MRI scans to assess individual differences in brain volumes. Our measures of daily functioning will include the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living measure (iADL), the Sheehan Disability Scale, and the WHO Quality of Life (WHO-QoL) questionnaire.","We will use multivariate dimension reduction techniques to determine the latent structure of the SAM in patients with Alzheimer's or MCI, and to form composite scores of neuropsychological performance and daily function. We will then use scores on each dimension of the SAM as moderator variables in a regression analysis predicting function from neuropsychological performance and brain volumes. ","The findings from this study will set the stage for future behavioural and neuroimaging research to examine the mechanisms underpinning individual differences in AM abilities and associated differences in cognitive aging and functional impairment. The main outcome of interest for this study is function in day-to-day life, yet individual differences in AM abilities may also translate to differences in more specific areas over time, such as decision making or problem solving. Uncovering how variability in AM across individuals relates to age-related cognitive and functional decline will help us better understand the mechanisms behind both AM and age-related memory decline. Furthermore, accounting for individual differences in AM and cognition allows for important progress to be made in understanding and predicting how individuals will function as they age. Knowledge resulting from this line of study can ultimately be used to develop new prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for age-related cognitive impairment that will improve the quality of life of older adults. Given that ONDRI includes longitudinal assessments, this study will also open up the opportunity to directly examine individual trajectories over time - in other words, whether individuals with low AM abilities show less functional decline as they age compared to individuals with high AM.

OND20180228JR,Joel Ramirez,Parkinson's disease and NOTCH3 genetic variation,"Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited monogenic small vessel disease caused by mutations in NOTCH3 which maps to the short arm of chromosome 19.[1-3] There is evidence that variants in this gene can rarely present with late onset, slowly progressive parkinsonism.

OND20180305ELa,Elena Leontieva,The association between retinal thickness and MRI parameters in patients with vascular cognitive impairment.,"Previous studies showed Retinal Nerve Fiber (RNFL) and Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL) thinning in participants following cerebral infarction (Anjos et al, 2016; Park et al, 2013; Gunes et al, 2016). Thinning of retinal parameters may be due to transneuronal degeneration following stroke. Rotterdam study showed that thinner RNFL, GCL, and inner plexiform layer were associated with smaller gray-matter and white-matter volume (Mutlu et al, 2017). To the best of our knowledge, relationships between retinal thickness parameters from SD-OCT and MRI parameters in patients with vascular cognitive impairment and past history of stroke have not been studied previously. This study investigates relationships between retinal thickness parameters assessed by SD-OCT and structural volumetric neuroimaging parameters assessed by MRI.","Study Aim:  1.

Appropriate accommodations for non-normally distributed measures will be performed.  The statistical approach will involve general linear mixed models for each outcome of interest.,The retinal thickness parameters can be useful non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers that may reflect a structural changes in the brain in participants with vascular cognitive impairment.
OND20180305ELc,Elena Leontieva,Evaluating structural and functional association in vascular cognitive impairment following stroke,"Cognitive decline is a hallmark manifestation of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) due to cerebral vascular disease. VCI develops from structural pathological changes in brain vessels which lead to inadequate supply of oxygen and nutrients to the brain tissue.  The absence of oxygen and nutrients delivery and disruptions in blood-brain barrier can lead to stroke which is the most common cause of VCI. Stroke causes damage and death of neurons and their axons resulting in functional deficits.     To our knowledge, the association between neuronal morphology and functional networks in VCI following stroke has never been investigated using multimodal approaches.  Therefore, in this study, we will examine the correlates between structural changes and functional decline in VCI following stroke.    Structural assessment will be performed using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT). Macrostructural MRI will provide volumetric stroke indicators and measures of neurovascular related brain injury, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics will provide us with valuable information about white matter microstructural integrity through quantification of direction and magnitude of water diffusion within neural tissue. SD-OCT non-invasively measures thickness of unmyelinated axons of retinal ganglion cells, the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) thickness. Additionally, the contribution of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking, glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1C), Body-Mass Index (BMI)) will be examined.      Functional deficits will be evaluated in both motor and cognitive domains by assessing speed of processing (SOP). Processing speed is a cognitive process reflecting how quickly information is being processed. It is usually assessed by simple reaction time on perceptual, motor, or more cognitively challenging tasks. In this study, functional deficits will be assessed via timed neuropsychological, gait, and eye tracking parameters. The definition and variations of SOP would be based on Proposal #1 in the series of SOP proposals.

OND20180612HR,Heidi Riek,Contributions of common genetic variants to executive function as indexed by prosaccade and antisaccade tasks    ,"The variability of cognitive symptomology and trajectory in neurodegenerative disease adds another facet of difficulty to a group of already complex diseases. Executive function can be widely variable between individuals and between disease groups, which introduces an additional degree of difficulty to predicting disease trajectory and symptoms and can reduce the efficacy of treatment. Existing literature suggests that some interindividual variability in cognitive function, such as response inhibition, working memory, attentional control, and cognitive flexibility, may be explained by common genetic variants affecting neurotransmission, neuronal stability and neuropathology. Pro- and anti-saccade tasks, which have been well-established as sensitive and informative measures of executive function and cognitive processing due to their activation of a fronto-parieto-subcortical network, can provide a variety of quantifiable parameters that correlate to aspects of executive function. Therefore, we intend to use behavioural parameters from the interleaved pro/antisaccade task in combination with data from the genomics, neuropsychology, and clinical platforms to examine the influence of common genetic variants on executive function in patients with all neurodegenerative diseases encompassed by ONDRI (AD/MCI, PD, ALS, FTD, VCI).","Our aim is to investigate the contributions of selected genetic polymorphisms to variability in cognitive function across neurodegenerative disease groups, measured primarily by performance on eye tracking tasks with supplemental neuropsychological tests. Ultimately, this will enable us to ascertain which genetic variants may influence interindividual variability in executive function in neurodegenerative disease, independent of effects on disease susceptibility. ","We expect to use data from the eye tracking, genomics, neuropsychology and clinical platforms in our analysis. Variables from the genomics platform include genotype for selected variants that have been selected from literature based on established associations with cognitive function (COMT rs4680, BDNF rs6265, ANKK1 rs1800497, APOE, MAPT haplotype). Variables of interest in the prosaccade and antisaccade tasks include mean saccade reaction time (SRT) of regular latency saccades, proportion of direction errors (corrected and uncorrected; this refers to saccades initially made in the incorrect direction on a given trial, which may later be corrected or not) and anticipatory errors, among others; these variables have been selected based on associations in literature of the selected variants with particular aspects of cognitive function that we hypothesize will affect eye movement parameters. Variables from the neuropsychology platform include scores on tests evaluating attention, executive function, working memory and processing speed (Trail-Making Test A/B, DKEFS color-word interference, DKEFS verbal fluency, WASI-III digit span and matrix reasoning, and SDMT). Variables from the clinical platform include age, gender, ethnicity, education, and disease-specific variables such as medication, which will be controlled for as part of the analysis. ","We will use correlational analysis to individually evaluate the association of each variant with specific behavioural parameters from the pro/antisaccade task according to established dominant, additive and recessive models. This will be done within each disease group as well as collectively among all disease groups in order to assess potential effects of each variant on general cognitive traits common to all neurodegenerative diseases. Relevant demographic and clinical variables (outlined above) will be controlled for as part of the analysis. We will also correlate scores on relevant neuropsychological tests to genotype for each variant as an additional avenue of investigation into genetic effects on cognitive function and as a point of comparison to previous literature. ","Most existing literature regarding genetics and neurodegenerative disease has aimed to establish whether certain variants affect susceptibility to particular diseases. A growing body of work has investigated the effect of genetic variants on cognition and cognitive variability both in healthy individuals and patient groups, which may improve prediction of cognitive trajectory and executive function in neurodegenerative disease. However, much of this work relies on an inconsistent battery of neuropsychological tests. Although links have been established between executive function and performance on the antisaccade task, and between certain genetic variants and executive function, to our knowledge no study has used the antisaccade task, a well-characterized microcosm of cognitive function, to probe the effects of these variants on executive function in neurodegenerative disease groups. This research may explain some cognitive symptom and trajectory variability within disease groups, as well as contribute to a body of literature that could eventually enable clinicians to use both simple eye-tracking tasks (ie. antisaccade and prosaccade tasks) and genetic testing to inform the cognitive prognosis of patients with neurodegenerative disease and thus individualize treatment plans to improve cognitive outcomes.

OND20180716JH,Jeff Huang,Pupil dynamics alteration in patients with neurodegenerative diseases,"Pupil size is a novel and low-cost candidate for assessing cognitive dysfunction in clinical setting, which is controlled by the balance activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems and is modulated by both bottom-up sensory and top-down cognitive signals, as well as arousal. Previous studies have found pupil responses to be modulated by the preparation of voluntary eye movements likely related to fronto-oculomotor network, and this modulation is disrupted in patients with executive function deficits. Subjects performed the interleaved pro-/anti-saccade task as part of the eye tracking platform, in which they were instructed via the colour of a fixation cue to generate either an automatic eye movement toward a peripheral stimulus (pro-saccade) or a voluntary eye movement in the opposite direction (anti-saccade).",Aim: To investigate changes in cognitive-related pupil responses in neurodegenerative patients  Hypothesis: Modulation of pupil dynamics by saccade preparation is altered by neurodegeneration related to frontal-oculomotor regions.   ,"Variables from the eye tracking platform and the clinical platform will be used in our analysis. Measures from the eye tracking platform includes saccade-related measures like Saccadic reaction time and Error rate, as well as pupil-related measures including Baseline pupil size, Pupil response onset latency, Pupil constriction size, Peak constriction time, Pupil constriction velocity, Pupil dilation size, and Pupil dilation velocity. Measures form the clinical platforms includes age, sex, MoCA scores, and disease specific variables such as medication and tests including the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, MDS-UPDRS, and Modified Rankin Scale",Descriptive statistics and graphical summaries for all variables of interest. Modulation by task condition will be analyzed for pupil and saccade variables. Correlation analysis will be performed between pupil dynamic measures with saccadic reaction time as well as with clinical scores.,The non-invasive measures of pupil dynamics can serve as biomarkers for autonomic deficits as well as and cognitive deficit in frontal-oculomotor regions  
OND20180722AR,Angela Roberts,Spoken Language Changes in Vascular Cognitive Impairment,"Difficulties monitoring early cognitive impairments outside of the clinic, and concomitant delays in treatment initiation, are major barriers to both the accurate diagnosis of and the development of interventions for cognitive impairments in individuals with vascular disease. Biomarkers can take a number of forms including observable behaviors. Spoken discourse (i.e., language beyond single words and sentences) is sensitive to early cognitive changes in dementia, making it a suitable biomarker target. Yet, to date no study has leveraged the sensitivity of spoken discourse for developing a biomarker of cognitive impairment in VCI. Previous studies of spoken discourse in VCI have found differences compared to healthy adults. However, these studies suffer from small sample sizes (< 20), lack of rigor in language sampling approaches, and insufficient characterization of the VCI cohort. The long-term objective of this research is to improve the ability to detect and monitor changes over time in individuals with vascular disease at risk for developing dementia, using a spoken discourse biomarker. Once the biomarker is systematically validated, computational approaches can be used to automate the biomarker analysis. ",This descriptive/observational study will:     Aim 1 will rigorously characterize the spoken discourse profiles of individuals with vascular disease with and without cognitive impairment.  Aim 2 will examine longitudinal changes in spoken discourse in individuals with vascular disease with and without baseline cognitive impairment.  Aim 3 will identify which variables predict (or interact to predict) change in spoken discourse over time in a vascular disease cohort.   ,"Spoken discourse variables including - but not limited to correct information units, language productivity metrics, grammaticality/syntax metrics, speech error/word retrieval error metrics, prosody patterns (NP platform analyzed in the applicants lab)  MoCA scores  Minimum data set cognitive test variables from the NP data used to classify participants into high/low cognition groups  Demographic variables (patient only - not care partner).

Descriptive data will be reported as a function of group (high vs. low cognitive performance at baseline). Generally, multi-level modelling and classification statistical procedures will be used to address the proposed aims.  These analysis procedures (provided data meet necessary assumptions) will account for the different types of data/variables to be analyzed and will facilitate the examination of individual and group level differences. Group comparisons will be conducted between the high and low cognition groups in the VCI cohort in order to address the primary aim of identifying behaviours at baseline that predict cognitive decline (and rates) longitudinally (over 1 year).","The proposed publication will be the most extensive publication on spoken discourse in VCI to date. It uniquely examines predictors of cognitive decline using language features extracted from clinically relevant spoken discourse tasks. It differs from existing studies that examine smaller cohorts of mixed dementia patients with healthy control comparator groups. The proposed publication significantly advances research and clinical care in VCI, and neurodegenerative disorders more broadly, by: 1) expanding our understanding of cognitive-linguistic phenotypes across the spectrum of VCI and 2) providing a rigorous, foundational, discourse dataset for developing automated analyses of biomarkers that monitor cognition in real world environments.

OND20180728AR,Angela Roberts,Vocal Quality and Articulation Measures Across Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Changes in phonatory and motor aspects of speech production have been well documented in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease and ALS that are characterized by their motor impairments.  Still yet, a number of gaps remain in the existing literature.  Chief among these are 1) a virtual absence of cross-disorder studies of phonatory and motor speech abilities in rigorously characterized cohorts and 2) the lack of studies documenting longitudinal changes in phonatory and motor speech abilities. The former is critical given the contributions of clinical motor speech features (e.g., apraxia and dysarthria feature subtypes) in discriminating neurodegenerative disorder subtypes and identifying therapeutic targets for behavioral interventions addressing speech impairments.  Current understandings of how neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., PD) map onto to specific dysarthria subtypes (e.g., hypokinetic dysarthria) are based on decades-old studies that included imprecisely characterized cohorts. Recent studies raise concerns over the accuracy of our current dysarthria subtype labels (e.g., Lansford and Liss, 2014). For example, individuals with VCI have not previously been included in cross-disorder phonatory and motor speech studies. Moreover, while recent studies raise the possibility of a relationship between cognition and motor speech abilities (Utianski et al., in press), few studies have specifically examined motor speech performance in the context of cognitive changes.","Aim 1. Examine how phonatory and motor speech behaviours differ across cohorts.  Aim 2. Examine how phonatory and motor speech behaviours change over time within cohorts  Aim 3. Identify which variables (i.e., disease group, age, cognition, gender, vascular disease) predict (or interact to predict) change over time.","Motor speech task extracted variables (NP platform analyzed in the applicants lab)  MoCA scores  Minimum data set cognitive test variables from the NP data  Demographic variables (patient only - not care partner).

Currently the applicant's lab is in the process of completing the analyses for all data through 24 months as we are responsible for the cleaning and analysis of these raw data. As such the data use for this publication are the same data analyzed by my lab that will ultimately be made available on the Brain Code site.  Using analysis scripts developed in the applicant's lab (specific to the ONDRI data) phonatory and motor speech variable data (e.g., fundamental frequency, harmonics to noise ratio) will be extracted from the ONDRI motor speech tasks and subjected to data cleaning procedures. Descriptive data (raw) and normalized values (z-scores based on previously published normal data by gender and age) will be reported. Generally, multi-level modelling and classification statistical procedures will be used to address the proposed aims.  These analysis procedures (provided data meet necessary assumptions) will account for the different types of data/variables to be analyzed and will facilitate the examination of individual and group level differences.","This will be the first cross-sectional and longitudinal study of phonatory and motor speech abilities in the proposed cohorts.

OND20180730AD,Allison A. Dilliott,The Genomics platform is requesting access to the family health history data  from the Clinical platform that has not yet been cleaned.,"Due to the number of genetic loci previously associated with neurodegenerative  diseases and targeted next-generation sequencing's (NGS's) ability to obtain high quality  data while remaining relatively inexpensive, the ONDRISeq panel was used as the  preliminary genetic analysis for the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research  Initiative (ONDRI)1. However, ONDRISeq only covers 80 previously associated genes,  limiting its ability to discover novel gene associations. Further, the ONDRISeq panel was  designed in 2013 and the ever expanding number of genetic analyses performed on  patients with neurodegenerative diseases have discovered new genes linked to the five  disease cohorts that were not included on the original panel2-5. For these reasons, we  propose that a subset of individuals who are variant negative upon analysis of ONDRISeq  data are considered for whole-exome NGS. Not only will this offer the ability to mine the  genes that have been more recently associated with neurodegenerative disease for  pathogenic genetic variation, but it may allow for the discovery of novel gene  Specify disease theme(s) you will use (√):  AD/MCI ☒  ALS ☒  FTD ☒  PD ☒  VCI ☒  associations.  In order to capitalize on this opportunity, obtaining the family health history from the  participants is vital. It is more likely that a large-effect rare variant is a major factor in the  pathogenesis of disease if a family history of disease in a blood-related individual is  present. Further, if affected blood-related family members are available and consent to  exome-sequencing, the exomes of multiple family members can be analyzed  concurrently. This allows for determining whether a variant is co-segregating with  disease expression within a family, providing corroborating evidence that a variant may  be pathogenic.  1. Dilliott, A.A. et al.

OND20180821HH,Seyyed Mohammad Hassan Haddad,Association between Cerebral Tissue Damage Severity and Gait performance in Patients with Vascular Cognitive Impairment,"Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is among the most common causes of dementia. According to recent statistics, pure vascular pathologies can lead to about 10% of all clinically diagnosed dementia cases. Acute forms of cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, double the risk of developing dementia. Patients with VCI can have large and small vessel strokes, small vessel disease, and microhemorrhages resulting in structural damage to cerebral tissue. These pathological alterations disturb the normal patterns of water diffusion within the cerebral tissue and as such are detectable using magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Cerebral tissue damage caused by VCI is not limited to ischemic regions/injuries. Irregular subtle structural alterations in normal-appearing areas including both normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal-appearing gray matter (NAGM) have also been reported using a variety of MR imaging modalities such as structural, vascular, and metabolic imaging. Since diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides diverse quantitative measures about various aspects of the cerebral tissue microstructure, such as integrity and anisotropy, it can be exploited to further study these subtle changes. Patients with VCI can have executive dysfunction, which can be manifested in gait disturbances. Recently, more sensitive gait measurements under dual-task or multi-task scenarios, including walking while performing other attention-demanding tasks, have been used as powerful tools to predict progression to dementia under diverse brain cognitive dysfunctions. In this project we will investigate the association between gait disturbances and subtle structural damage of the cerebral tissue, mainly region-based NAWN and NAGM, evaluated using DTI in VCI patients. This study will provide more detailed information about the association between cognitive performance and pathological alterations caused by cerebrovascular disease and its application for more precise assessments of the severity of the VCI.","In this research study we have two specific aims:  1.	To investigate associations between diverse DTI scalar parameters and gait measurements in the baseline data of VCI patients.  2.	To determine which DTI scalar parameters and brain regions predict gait abnormalities.","1.	DTI scalar parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)  2.

OND20180913HH,Seyyed Mohammad Hassan Haddad,"A Novel Brain Activity Metric based on Spontaneous Low Frequency BOLD Signal from Resting-state fMRI: Brain Activity Profiles in Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer Disease, and Frontotemporal Dementia","Volumetric evaluation of brain atrophy using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and molecular metabolic measurements acquired by 18F labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), are well-established neuroimaging indicators of Alzheimer disease (AD) progression and treatment response. Recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) specifically resting-state fMRI has been widely used as a novel tool to study functional connectivity (FC) in the human brain under conditions of cognitive dysfunction. As a very rudimentary interpretation, FC provides a measure of correlated neuronal activity from several spatially distinct brain regions over time. Resting-state fMRI, relying on low frequency fluctuations (0.01 to 0.1 Hz) of the blood Oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal, represents correlated networks within the brain gray matter regions at rest.  A number of recent studies have reported disrupted connectivity in the resting state network activity maps of the brain in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and more severe conditions, such as AD and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). For instance, lower FC, independent of brain atrophy, was reported in AD patients within the default-mode network (DMN) in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex compared with controls. FC values in these regions in MCI patients were found to lie between those in AD patients and controls. Moreover, decreased FC in AD patients compared to controls was found in inferior parietal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, MCI subjects represented less pronounced suppression in posterior cingulate cortex connectivity in comparison with AD subjects. Other research studies have found that the pathophysiology of resting-state FC is different between AD and behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD). For instance, in FTD reduced network-to-region connectivity in bvFTD between lateral visual cortical network and lateral occipital and cuneal cortex was observed; whereas in AD network-to-region connectivity between the dorsal visual stream network and lateral occipital and parietal opercular cortex was impaired. Frontal regions in patients with FTD also showed less linear activation increase in comparison with similar regions in AD subjects as observed in memory task fMRI. Disrupted frontolimbic connectivity and abnormal augmented localized FC in the prefrontal cortex were also reported in FTD subjects using resting-state fMRI. These studies provide strong evidence that resting-state FC varies between MCI, AD, and FTD conditions.  Classically, in the fMRI technique, the strength of the correlation in the BOLD signal from different brain regions is considered as the measure of the FC. Nonetheless, to date such fMRI-based measures did not prove to be capable to provide quantitative biomarkers to reliably differentiate between MCI, AD, and FTD subjects. Recently, in Dr. Bartha's lab a new quantitative measure of brain activity was developed and introduced (Kazemifar et al, 2017). This activity metric is quantified based on the first-order texture feature defined as the standard deviation (STD) of the magnitude of the BOLD fluctuation. In this study, we will attempt to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of the introduced neuronal activity measure and drive a more sensitive quantitative measure of neuronal activity, based on more sophisticated texture features of the resting-state fMRI signal to detect subtle FC variations between MCI, AD, and FTD subjects.","In this research study we follow two specific aims:  1. To theoretically devise a novel neuronal activity measure based on the resting-state fMRI signal and ICA, and to develop the necessary image processing and statistical analysis software tools to automatically quantify and depict this measure as a neuronal activity map across the brain of the subject scanned by standard MR scanners.  2. To utilize these quantified resting-state activity maps to assess neuronal activity variations between MCI, AD, and FTD subjects. To this end, region-based sophisticated statistical analysis approaches will be used to assess the significance and accuracy of neuronal activity differences between MCI, AD, and FTD subjects.",The novel brain activity metric derived from the resting-state fMRI signal,"1.	The aforementioned developed image processing and statistical analysis software tools will be used to quantify neuronal activity across the brain.  2.	This measure is scrutinized in a number of important gray matter regions expected or likely to be influenced by neurocognitive disorders such as hippocampus, putamen, pallidum, caudate, accumbens, thalamus, amygdala, cerebellum, etc. It is noteworthy that these regions will be segmented automatically based on well-known human brain atlases and image processing software packages, which are freely available to researchers in the neuroscience community.  3.	Mean, median, extremum (maximum and minimum), STD, coefficient of variations (CV), or other relevant statistical parameters of the neuronal activity measure are quantified within the abovementioned gray matter regions.  4.	Appropriate statistical tests (such as t-test or ANOVA test) will be conducted to determine the significance and accuracy of the variations of the region-based statistical parameters (quantified in the previous step) between MCI, AD, and FTD subjects.","1.	A novel brain activity measure based on the resting-state fMRI signal will be devised and tested.  2.	The sensitivity and specificity of this brain activity metric in different gray matter structures will be evaluated for the discrimination of AD, MCI, and FTD subjects.  3.	This research will provide more insight into the efficacy of the novel brain activity metric as a potential biomarker to evaluate the current state of the brain in MCI, AD, or FTD and even estimate disease progression."
OND20180918HH,Seyyed Mohammad Hassan Haddad,Association between Brain Volume Changes and Gait Performance in People with Vascular Cognitive Impairment,"Poorer mobility including gait is strongly associated cross-sectionally and longitudinally with cognitive decline. Specifically, fluctuations in time from one step to the next (i.e. variability) are associated with higher order cognitive problems and high risk of falls. Cognitive deficits and falls are both frequently associated with global volumetric alterations in the brain, including smaller sensorimotor and frontoparietal regions, lower global white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) volumes, as well as lower right and left hippocampal volumes in pre-dementia stages. An inverse association between gait speed and total white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume in older adults with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) was also reported in the literature. While cerebrovascular disease is regarded as the second most important cause of dementia after Alzheimer disease (AD), few studies have comprehensively investigated the association between global and regional brain volume alterations due to vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and gait control parameters. This association will be interesting to examine as a number of research studies have reported correlations between brain atrophy (decrement in the size of neurons) after stroke and WMHs, lacunae, as well as silent brain infarctions. Therefore we propose to examine the relationship between volumetric structural alterations of the brain in VCI patients assessed using brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and gait performance measures. The outcome of this research will provide insight into the brain structural alterations associated with VCI and their impact on cognitive/executive function evaluated by gait measurements.","In this research study we follow two specific aims:  1.

OND20181022AV,Anthony Vaccarino,"Comorbid depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances and their impact on quality of life and functioning in neurodegenerative disorders and MDD","One of OBI's key goals is support scientific inquiry across multiple brain disorders. To enable these comparisons, Brain-CODE Common Data Elements (CDEs) have been implemented across IDPs to assess key constructs, including depression (QIDS), anxiety (GAD-7), sleep (PSQI), quality of life (WHO-Qol-BREF) and day-to-day functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale), as well as consistent recording of demographic and health information. These CDEs provide standard definitions and formats so that investigators collect data consistently across studies and increase opportunities for sharing and conducting integrated analyses across IDP disease platforms.     In the present proposal, we will use the Brain-CODE CDEs collected within the CAN-BIND (CBN01) and ONDRI (OND01) to better characterize symptom profile and comorbidity across different diseases, as well as to validate these scales in disease groups they were not originally developed.      The present proposal will:    1.	Assess prevalence of comorbid depression (QIDS), anxiety (GAD-7) and sleep disturbances (PSQI) in AD, PD, VCI, ALS, FTD and MDD and their impact on quality of life (WHO-QoL) and functioning  (Sheehan) (AIM 1) .     2.	Validate the Brain-CODE CDEs across disease cohorts. The psychometric properties of the Brain-CODE CDEs (QIDS, GAD-7, PSQI) will be assessed across ONDRI disease platforms (AD, PD, VCI, ALS, FTD) and CAN-BIND (MDD and healthy controls) (AIM 2).  ","Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in neurological disorders, including changes in mood, anxiety and sleep difficulties that contribute to poor quality of life and impaired functioning. Using the Brain-CODE CDEs, AIM 1 of this proposal will assess the prevalence of comorbid depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances in neurodegenerative disorders and MDD and their impact on quality of life and functioning. The results will provide valuable insights into disease symptomatology and help guide treatment strategies.       It is important to recognize although the psychometric properties of Brain-CODE CDEs have been established within defined populations, they do not necessarily carry-over from one population to another. For example, the QIDS was designed to assess depressive symptomatology in depressive disorder and to date has not been validated to assess depression in neurological disorders. It is essential, therefore, to also establish the scale's validity by studying the properties of instruments in each population for which it is being used. Indeed, the complex array of motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in neurological disease certainly might be expected to affect scale performance.

Item Response Theory (IRT) provides for examination of the psychometric properties of instruments, and is particularly suited for comparison across different patient groups as it considers both the item and person characteristics in assessing psychometric properties. Previous research by our team has demonstrated the value of using IRT to assess scale performance and symptom profiles different across diseases (Huntington Disease and MDD).    To evaluate the psychometric properties of the CDEs across disease groups, IRT analyses will be applied within each of the disease groups, including:    Differential Item Functioning (DIF) will be used to determine the extent to which the item might be measuring different abilities across different groups. Average item scores for subgroups having the same overall score on the test will be compared to determine whether the item is measuring in essentially the same way for all subgroups.    Person-item maps (Rasch modelling; a type of IRT) will provide a measure of how difficult or easy an item is relative to the subject and thus can be used to assess the relevance of an item to that population. Items that fall within the targeted population will be considered within acceptable criteria. Pearson-item maps will be generated for each scale within each disease group.    Option Characteristic Curves (OCCs) will be used to display the probability of a particular option score (i.e., a score of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) for each item as a function of overall level of severity. As such, OCCs provide a graphical representation of how informative a particular item (or symptom) is as a measure of illness. An item is informative if the options within each items can discriminate severity in an orderly fashion. For each CDE within each disease group, OCCs will be generated for each item in relation to overall score.    To complement these IRT analyses, analyses based on classical test theory will also be conducted, including factor analyses, inter-item correlations, item-to-total correlations and Chronbach's alpha   ","Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in neurological disorders, including changes in mood, anxiety and sleep difficulties that contribute to poor quality of life and impaired functioning.

OND20181108MG,Maged Goubran,Towards stroke recovery prognosis from automated brain imaging analyses,"Stroke refers to an injury from vascular disease that ablates/injures brain, contributing to death, disability, or impairment. While acute stroke therapies have improved outcomes in recent years, most stroke survivors are left with lingering and long-standing impairments, a plight now shared by over 700,000 Canadians. For example, anterior-medial thalamic strokes tend to produce cognitive impairment [1], while corticospinal tract lesions exceeding 7.0cc in volume are associated with poor motor outcomes [2]. Post-stroke cognitive impairment at the sub-acute stage is an important indication because these deficits lead to greater functional impairment [3]. The current gold standard for lesion segmentation relies on hand tracings. Despite long standing development [4], automated stroke segmentation has failed to achieve the accuracy of a radiologist. There is thus a need to advance stroke recovery on many fronts. The most pressing needs are to quickly and automatically identify the brain areas lesioned by stroke, and to improve accuracy in predicting resultant impairments. ","Aim 1: Use multi-contrast research-grade anatomical MR images to automatically segment stroke lesions and distinguish between stroke cortical and subcortical infarcts from other lesions and pathologies such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunar infarcts with high accuracy through deep learning. Hypothesis: A novel 3D convolutional neural network will accurately predict the spatial location of either sub-acute and chronic stroke, as well as WMH lesions based on multi-contrast images relative to ground truth segmentations.  Aim 2: Determine whether clinical scores, the stroke lesion map, and diffusion and functional connectivity map features can be used to predict impairment. Hypothesis: Combining lesion features from Aim-1 with clinical, functional and diffusion MRI connectivity feature maps will produce accurate prognostic models of motor and cognitive impairment.  ","Clinical: Age, Sex, Education, days post stroke, Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool (MoCA), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score and NIH stroke severity (NIHSS).   Neuroimaging: Hand traced stroke segmentations from SABRE, semi-automated WMH segmentations, automated stroke and WMH segmentations, stroke and WMH location, DTI & fMRI metrics from connectivity feature maps  ","Aim 1: We will implement a 3-dimensional CNN - known as a U-Net - that takes multi-contrast MR images (T1w, T2w, and FLAIR) as model inputs and uses ground truth binary lesion maps as outputs. We will validate the model accuracy to manual ground-truth labels using Dice similarity and volume correlations. Another recent 'Hetero-Modal Image Segmentation' approach [5] will be implemented to account for missing data. We will also evaluate test-retest reliability from repeat MRI scanning and the predictive accuracy of the model when only single-contrast MRI data are available.  Aim 2: We will build neural networks, incorporating the stroke lesion mask, functional (fMRI: amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, default mode and sensorimotor connectivity maps) and structural (DTI: fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps) imaging features. These rich multi-contrast images will be used to predict cognitive impairment on a per-patient basis. Our two impairment outcomes are: 1) the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score below 22, and 2) the modified Rankin Score (mRS) above 2. Prognostic yield will be defined as the proportion of patients fulfilling at least one of the 2 threshold criteria. We will include age, sex, days post stroke, education, stroke type, lesion volume, and fMRI nuisance effects (e.g. head motion) as covariates of non-interest.   ","With a fast and accurate automated stroke lesion segmentation, we hope to increase capacity of clinical stroke teams (i.e. neurologists and radiologists), such as automated reporting and prognostic recovery markers that are summarized and aggregated from the imaging and clinical data. Our second aim is to build reliable predictions of recovery after stroke based on lesion topology/statistics, functional connectivity patterns, diffusion and perfusion MRI characteristics, and clinical metrics. A prognostic model will provide invaluable help for the clinical decision process and will potentially identify patients at-risk of poor cognitive and motor outcomes."

Stage 1: Outlier analyses across all samples and all data. Stage 2: Mixed-data multiple factor analysis (MFA) across all data and all samples but accounting for outliers identified in Stages 1 and 2. MFA is a multi-table principal components analysis. Stable variables will be identified through bootstrap resampling, stable components will be identified through split-half resampling. Stable components will be used to define the spectrums. Hierarchical clustering and cluster stability (via, e.g., Calinski-Harabasz) will be performed on the component scores of only the stable components for all individuals in order to identify 'biotypes'. The biotypes classify individuals into groups. These new data-driven groups will be compared against recruitment groups (and subtypes). Participants that were excluded from Stage 2 will be projected onto these components, and into the 'biotype' groups post-hoc; this is to ensure that outliers do not influence the structure, but we can still understand their role across neurodegeneration. Any missing data > 10% will be excluded. Remaining missing data will be imputed through a combination of informed imputation (using missing codes) and best estimations with multivariate techniques. Outlier thresholds will be set to 90%. Expected N for Stage 3 is N~=450.       A comparable discriminant analog of the above will also be performed (i.e., 'discriminant mixed-data MFA') to compare the structure from a priori specified groups vs. data-driven (no groups)","This work would approach neurodegenerative disorders from a data-driven perspective in order to reveal spectrums and biotypes of neurodegeneration based on well-established and strong theoretical markers of neurodegenerative disorders (i.e., volumetric data, specific genetic markers, and robust neuropsych. tests).

OND20181122FF,Frederico Pieruccini-Faria,Gait and Balance Performances As Biomarkers of Neurodegenerative Progression,"In our article published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease 2017 describing the ONDRI Gait and Balance protocol we postulated that common neural substrates would mediate motor performance across neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, motor and cognitive performance as well as specific clinical characteristics can be used as indexes of neurodegenerative progression in all neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, memory, executive functions impairments are often associated with reduced gait performance among older adults and in neurodegeneration. Gait impairments are often present in the spectrum of neurodegenerative progression and can be considered an effective and inexpensive predictor of cognitive decline and mortality among older adults. However, it is unclear whether gait performance can be used as a marker of rapid cognitive decline and neurodegeneration across all neurodegenerative diseases. ","In this proposal we test the hypothesis that gait performance would be a common predictor of rapid progression of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration across diseases.  1-	To determine whether gait performance at baseline is associated with rapid progression of global cognitive performance, memory and executive functions across all ONDRI Cohorts.  2-	To determine the cerebral mediators of potential associations between gait performance and progression of cognitive decline over the follow up period.  3-	To determine the association between gait performance at baseline and the risk of rapid cortical and subcortical changes linked to disease progression in each cohort, during the follow-up period.   ","Demographics, clinical, gait performance, neuropsychological performance and neuroimaging variables across all 5 cohorts will be used. Cognitive longitudinal data from all visits include MoCA (Global cognition), Rey-Auditory verbal learning delayed recall (Memory), Trail Making Test A-B difference (Executive functions); Neuroimaging longitudinal data include white matter hyperintensities, diffusion tensor imaging and volumetrics from cortical and subcortical areas associated with pathogenesis of each disease cohort. The APOE-4 genotype at baseline will be used as a marker of potential higher risk for rapid cognitive decline and will be used as a covariate in all analysis. Gait speed performance during single-task and dual-task conditions will be entered as predictors of cognitive and neurodegenerative progression. ","Decline (i.e. an event) in cognitive performance and cerebral substrates during the follow-up are defined when values dropped or raised (depending on the variable) 1.5 standard deviations, below or above the average of the disease cohort at baseline. Time-to-events during the follow-up will be created for each dependent variable. For the predictive variable, individuals in each cohort will be split into slow and fast walkers during single and dual-task conditions at baseline only. This will allow us determining whether gait performance at baseline predicts the rate of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration during the follow up period. Furthermore, neural substrates often considered the pathogenesis of disease progression in each cohort will be entered as covariates so that we can also estimate whether they play a mediation role in the associations between gait performance and cognitive decline during follow-up. Decline in neural markers of disease progression will also be entered as dependent variables in the regression analysis in order to establish the existence of a direct relationship between gait performance and neurodegenerative processes in the brain. These associations will be estimated using Hazard Ratios calculated with Cox proportional regression models adjusted for baseline clinical and demographics. A minimum of 10 events per variable will be necessary to power the statistical analysis. Basic adjustments for, age, sex, years of education, baseline cognitive performance, number of comorbidities, APOE-4 and disease severity at baseline will be entered as covariates in all statistical models.",This study will be the first to reveal whether gait impairments are common sensitive markers of progression in the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. This knowledge could help clinicians better estimate the efficacy of current treatments and prognosis using simplified and inexpensive assessments. 
OND20181123FF,Frederico Pieruccini-Faria,Mapping the roles of cognition and cortical substrates on gait performance in VCI and MCI.,"In our article published on JAD 2017 describing the ONDRI Gait and Balance protocol we postulated that gait and balance commonalities will be observed across neurodegenerative diseases. Cognitive deficits are present in Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) both intermediate stages between normal cognition and dementia. These entities can also cause gait and balance impairments due to disruptions in cognitive networks in the brain. Dual-task gait performance in older adults is associated with progression to dementia. While memory problems seem to be associated with gait dysfunction in MCI, executive function seems to explain gait impairments found in VCI, although inconsistent findings have been observed in the literature.  Furthermore, it is unclear whether gait impairments in each cognitive entity are related to common or different neural substrates in these cohorts.

OND20181126MM,Manuel Montero-Odasso,White matter hyperintensity burden and microstructure integrity across neurodegenerative disorders,"In our article published in JAD 2017 describing the ONDRI Gait and Balance protocol we postulated that commonalities across diverse neurodegenerative disorders could be linked to the white matter (WM) hyperintensity burden and white matter microstructural integrity.  Specifically, these imaging changes would be observed in shared brain networks that control cognition and motor performance, which are highly susceptible to microvascular brain disease.  Thus, we propose to examine the WM hyperintensity burden, and WM microstructure across the neurodegenerative clinical cohorts in ONDRI.

OND20181127DB,Derek Beaton,"Individual and group-level neurodegenerative disease resting state multivariate profiles with respect to, but in the absence of, comparison or control data. ","The ONDRI study has collected data across five neurodegenerative diseases. The ONRI study does not include any control or comparison groups or data. However, in order to understand various aspects of neurodegenerative disorders, we must be able to compare to a control or reference set. In many domains, and especially across many of ONDRI's platforms, an abundance of reference data could be made available through either (1) other studies or (2) data structures with strong theoretical basis. Furthermore, characterization of data-especially in neurodegeneration where there are spectrums of severity and pathology-should exist at both the group level (e.g., VCI, AD/MCI) and the individual level. Our proposed work here has two aims: (1) characterize individual and group-level resting state fMRI connectivity network profiles, and (2) introducing a robust and flexible statistical technique to allow ONDRI data to be analyzed with respect to a theoretical control structure, but in the absence of any actual control or comparative data. To do so, we introduce a new method called K+1-CovSTATIS (K+1CS). K+1CS is a hybrid multivariate technique that combines features of partial least squares and STATIS ('Structuration des Tableaux a Trois Indices de la Statistique'; roughly translated to 'structuring three way statistical tables'), which is a multi-table (partial triadic) principal components analysis. K+1CS works by computing all of the individual connectivity profiles with respect to a reference structure; in our case, the reference structure could be a canonical network structure (e.g., resting state) or one of the various network parcellations (e.g., Schaffer, Glaser, Yeo, Power), or derived from meta- and/or ontological analyses (e.g., NeuroSynth, Laird/BrainMap, NeuroVault). The reference structure provides a hypothesized control structure (covariance or correlation matrix) without the need to obtain any control data: this is the 'K+1' part. We then leverage all individual data to compute a compromise (entire sample) connectivity profile, as well as five group level (per cohort) as well as all individual profiles, which would identify unique signatures per group or per individual, as well as help identify outliers in complex data (but conditional to a hypothesized network structure). Resampling (e.g., robust bootstrap) is used to generate general distribution bounds per individual and disease group.","The aim of this study is two-fold: (1) identify group and spectrum (ignoring cohort) rsfMRI signatures in the ONDRI data set, and (2) introduce a technique essential for ONDRI: a way to compute individual and group level results with respect to reference (hypothesized) correlation structures even in the absence of actual control data.  With respect to application: We expect to identify unique connectivity signatures for each cohort, but more importantly, to reveal spectrums (biotypes) of profiles that cross the cohort boundaries.

OND20181212PR,Pradeep Reddy Raamana,To compare two different QC workflows in terms of their error detection rate in cortical parcellations from Freesurfer,"FreeSurfer is a popular software package for fully-automated whole-brain cortical reconstruction of the human brain from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans [1]. However, due to the challenging nature of the reconstruction, this process leads to errors in parcellation. Failure to correct or omit them from analyses could result in erroneous and irreproducible results, and hence quality control (QC) is crucial. The only reliable way to detect the errors in FreeSurfer parcellation is via visual inspection [2], which is both tedious and time consuming, especially with large datasets. One of the approaches to QC large datasets is the imaging QC protocol from the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium (ENQC) [3]. ENQC is a practical approach to expedite this process by selecting 4 slices for inspection. While drastically reducing the amount of work for the rater, this increases the likelihood of missing subtle errors, as they may fall between the limited number of views. To address this, VisualQC [4], a new open source software package, was developed to be a seamless workflow to improve the ease of use as well as accuracy in error detection, by 1) presenting larger number of slices to reduce the risk of missed errors, and 2) allowing the user to adjust this number to account for datasets with scans that may require a more thorough examination for errors. By combining all views and the error rating screen into one seamless interface, VisualQC also creates an vastly improved workflow compared to ENQC, which separates internal and external views, and the rating spreadsheet. In this study, we both quantify the error detection rate using both methods, and show that VisualQC is a viable upgrade to ENQC.    ",Exploratory analysis,Error detection rate,"Two datasets were drawn from previous studies - Canadian biomarker integration network in depression (CAN-BIND): 308 participants (111 controls, 197 diagnosed with major depressive disorder, age: 34.45 ± 12.13 years) [5] and a disease theme from the Ontario Neurodegeneration Research Initiative (ONDRI) [6]: 140 participants with Parkinson's (67.94 ± 6.35 years) - to provide a wide range of participants analyzed through both protocols. Each dataset was also processed using two versions of FreeSurfer (5.3 and 6.0) to test how this might affect error percentages. All error inspection was completed by the same rater, using the same criteria for failure as outlined by the ENIGMA protocol [3], for consistency. The error detection rate (EDR) for every brain region was calculated for each dataset, review method, FreeSurfer software version and lateral hemisphere as the number of participants with detected errors, divided by the total number of participants in that dataset.",Developing easier and more accurate quality control protocols is fundamentally important in the age of increasingly large and complex neuroimaging data.
OND20181217AH,Avner Hostovsky,Optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings as a biomarker in Parkinson Disease,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective loss of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra, as well as the accumulation of intracellular alpha-synuclein protein aggregates (Lewy Bodies/neurites). The disease has a heterogeneous phenotypic spectrum, and biomarkers specific for diagnosis have remained elusive. Identification of such biomarkers would represent a major step forward in the field, as an accurate diagnosis is often difficult given the overlap in clinical symptoms/signs between different neurodegenerative diseases, and the presence of co-pathology at autopsy.    Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive tool used for measuring the thickness and volume of ocular structures, primarily the retina. Retinal ganglion cells (and higher visual areas) are dopamine-producing cells, and prior studies have shown abnormalities in PD patients compared to controls. The retina in PD patients is deficient in dopamine (Hajee et al 2009, Harnois et al 1990), and alpha-synuclein cytoplasmic aggregates have been demonstrated in the inner retinal layers at autopsy (Bodis-Wollner et al 2014 Neurology).     OCT measurements in PD patients have shown conflicting results. Several studies have shown retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thinning in PD patients compared to healthy controls (Sule Aydin et al 2017), but some studies have found that the difference was mainly intraretinal and not related to the RNFL (Mailankody et al 2015). Furthermore, sub-segmentation of retinal layers has shown thinning in some layers but increased thickness in others (Chorostecki et al 2015). Recent improvement in the OCT technology allows the Spectralis OCT to perform an automatic differentiation and quantification of the 10 retinal layers. A single study that used this technology in Parkinson patients showed correlation between the ganglion cell layer and disease duration and severity as measured by the Hoehn & Yahr scale (Garcia-Martin et al 2013). The main weakness in that study is the long disease duration of its patients (average of more than 8 years), which eliminate the possibility to evaluate the progression of the retinal thinning in different disease stages.     In the present study we plan to use this improvement in technology to measure the retinal layers thickness and volume in patients with shorter disease duration, between 3 to 8 years. Capturing the retina thickness before the end-stage thinning has accrued may provide a better understanding of the rate of progression of thinning in the different retinal layers, which could act as a biomarker for disease duration, severity and possibly clinical subtypes.       ","We hypothesize that thickness of different layers of the retina will correlate to clinical measures of PD: 1) disease severity as measured by UPDRS, 2) disease duration, and 3) PD clinical subtypes (e.g. tremor-dominant, akinetic rigid, PD dementia).","1)	OCT data: total retinal thickness & volume, RNFL thickness, macular cube volume, inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, thickness and volume  2)	PD data: disease duration (months), severity (UPDRS scores), clinical PD subtypes (MOCA, tremor dominant, akinetic rigid, PD dementia)  ",The study will be a retrospective cross-sectional study design to examine the correlations between OCT data and clinical measures.,"The significance of this study is to determine whether or not these OCT data could be a readily accessible, non-invasive biomarker for PD disease severity/progression, as well as conferring potentially useful prognostic information."
OND20181227AR,Angela Roberts,"Noun and Verb Confrontation Naming in Parkinson's Disease: Cognitive impairment, accuracy, latency, and error patterns","Word retrieval errors are common in neurodegenerative disorders. Reduced accuracy and slower retrieval during confrontation naming tasks are associated with cognitive impairments. Recent studies highlight the potential for noun-verb confrontation naming accuracy dissociations in PD (verbs being more impaired). Yet other studies show that individuals with PD differ from controls in both noun and verb confrontation naming, particularly in the context of PD-MCI.  While accuracy and latency data are important, alone they do not reveal the underlying nature of word retrieval impairments. Previous research in Alzheimer's dementia and in stroke-induced aphasia suggest that specific types of word retrieval errors map onto specific word-retrieval processes (i.e., lexical vs. semantic).  Such distinctions are not trivial.  Disruptions to different word retrieval processes are associated with distinct neural disruptions and cognitive processes that may predict individuals at higher risk for cognitive decline. While frequently investigated in MCI/AD and in aphasia, no study to date has examined the nature of word retrieval impairments in PD (lexical vs. semantic) and the potential for individual and group level differences in word-retrieval impairments as a function of cognitive impairment.","Aim 1 will identify group differences in accuracy, latency, and error patterns (lexical vs. semantic) for confrontation naming of nouns and verbs in individuals with PD (with and without MCI).  Aim 2 will examine cognitive predictors of confrontation naming accuracy, latency and error patterns (lexical vs. semantic) for individuals with PD (with and without MCI).    Hypotheses:  1. The PD-MCI group will differ from the PD group in both accuracy (lower) and latency (longer) for both noun and verb confrontation naming tasks.  2. Compared to the PD group, the PD-MCI group will demonstrate a higher proportion of semantic-related naming errors.  3. We predict individual differences in naming performance such that performance on executive control measures (e.g., attention, working memory) will be associated with a predominant pattern of lexical retrieval errors and performance on episodic and semantic tasks (BDAE) will be associated with a predominant pattern of semantic retrieval errors.

Aim 3 will be analyzed using multi-level regression approaches that will help facilitate understanding both group effects and individual differences.,"The proposed publication will be the first to comprehensively examine specific word-retrieval error patterns (lexical vs. semantic) in PD.  Doing so will inform theoretical models of word retrieval. Importantly these findings may reveal unique patterns of word retrieval difficulties (beyond accuracy and latency) that will inform which patients are at elevated risk for developing dementia. These data will be expanded in future publications examining the longitudinal data for confrontation naming in the same cohort.  Moreover, developing effective interventions for 'tip of the tongue phenomenon' for individuals with PD, a relatively common and frustrating concern, depends on understanding the underlying processes that impact word retrieval in PD."
OND20190104AD,Allison A. Dilliott,APOE E4 and cognitive functioning in the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative.,"We have demonstrated with the ONDRI data that the APOE E4 allele is associated with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment risk in a dose-dependent manner; however, no associations were found between the risk allele and any other neurodegenerative diseases under study (submitted Dilliott et al., 2018). Yet, it is still to be determined whether APOE is associated with any of the many measures of neurodegeneration within our cohorts.  Cognitive impairment has varying prevalence across the five neurodegenerative diseases studied under the ONDRI mandate. Further, within a single disease cohort, participants have varying degrees of cognitive functioning. Every participant within ONDRI undergoes a gold standard neurocognitive battery to assess cognitive functioning. Further, the participants undergo a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which is a simple, widely used screening tool for detecting degree of cognitive impairment. The assessment measures various aspects of cognitive abilities, including visuospatial and executive functioning, short-term memory recall, attention and working memory, language abilities, and orientation.  Previously, the APOE E4 allele has been negatively associated with cognitive functioning including language, attention, recall, executive, and visuo-spatial functioning, in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (Smits et al., 2015, Eur Neuropschopharmacol), Parkinson's disease (Mata et al., 2014, JAMA Neurol), and vascular cognitive impairment (McGuinness et al. 2010, Neurosci Lett), yet other studies have disputed these claims (Ballard et al., 2001, Int J Geriatr Psychiatry; Mengel et al., 2016, Parkinsonism Relat Disord). Importantly, no single study has assessed the effect of the E4 allele on cognitive decline across all five neurodegenerative diseases encompassed by ONDRI.","In this publication, or series of publications, we aim to investigate the relationship between APOE E4 and cognitive impairment as measured using the minimal data set from the neuropsychology platform. Further, we will also investigate whether the E4 allele is associated with the MoCA screening tool and particular aspects of the MoCA scoring. Once longitudinal data becomes available we also aim to investigate the relationship between APOE E4 and changes in cognitive functioning.  We hypothesize that APOE E4 carrier status will be associated with decreased cognitive functioning, particularly in regards to executive functioning and recall, as determined by the neuropsychology minimum dataset, across the five neurodegenerative diseases. We expect that these results will be replicated in by an association between the APOE E4 carrier status and decreased MoCA scoring, across the five neurodegenerative diseases. We also hypothesize that APOE E4 carrier status will also be associated with a greater rate of cognitive decline in the analysis of longitudinal data.  ","Genomics:  APOE genotyping  Clinical:   Age, gender, MoCA, disease specific history (to obtain AD versus MCI diagnoses)  Neuropsychology:  All measures within the minimal dataset and the BVMT copy trial from the full dataset","Multivariate analysis of variance will be used to analyze associations between APOE E4 carrier status and measures encompassed by the neuropsychology minimum dataset and the BVMT copy trial from the full dataset (as per Paula's suggestion). Analysis of variance will be used to analyze the association between APOE E4 carrier status and MoCA score, including covariates such as age, sex, and education. Multivariate analysis of variance will also be used to analyze associations between APOE E4 carrier status and the sub-scores of the MoCA.  These analyses will be performed across the entire ONDRI cohort and within each disease cohort. The analysis may also be performed following subgrouping the AD and MCI participants.","This work will contribute to the understanding of the overall effect of APOE across various neurodegenerative diseases. As the lines between these diagnoses are often blurred, investigating genetic associations, such as those with APOE E4 carrier status, may provide further explanation for features of individuals' diseases. Therefore, a genetic test following neurodegenerative disease diagnosis may provide insight as to what features of cognitive functioning may be more likely to decline throughout the disease progression. In this way, APOE may be able to act as a genetic biomarker correlated to disease progression and outcomes.  "
OND20190212PM,Paula McLaughlin,Verbal Fluency Patterns in FTD and ALS,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD) are progressive, neurodegenerative disorders that have been associated with behavioural deficits and decline in cognitive abilities, particularly those involving frontal and temporal lobes (Strong, 2008; Strong et al., 2017; Lepow et al., 2010). Studies have shown that there is an association between ALS and FTD in that an estimated 15% of individuals with FTD develop ALS, and between 5 and 22% of individuals with ALS develop FTD (Ringholz et al., 2005; Raaphorst et al., 2010; Lomen-Hoerth et al., 2003). Given the similarities between these disorders, as well as other dementias (e.g., atypical Alzheimer's disease), clinical discrimination can be challenging (Hernandez et al., 2014). On the other hand, given the similarities between ALS and FTD, these have been posited to be part of a larger spectrum of disease (Murphy et al., 2007).     Verbal fluency tasks have been frequently used in studies due to their sensitivity in measuring cognitive dysfunction (Lepow et al., 2010; Canning et al., 2004; Libon et al., 2009). Deficits on both phonemic and semantic fluency measures have been widely demonstrated in patients with ALS and FTD (Lepow et al., 2010; Abrahams et al., 2000; Libon et al., 2009; Saxon et al., 2017). Deficits have been described in terms of a decreased number of total words generated compared to healthy controls (Lepow et al., 2010; Strong et al., 1999; Robinson et al., 2006), with various patterns of performance noted. Specifically, ALS bulbar-onset patients tend to perform worse on these measures compared to limb-onset (Strong et al., 1999; Robinson et al, 2006; Schreiber et al., 2005), and show overall worse performance on phonemic compared to semantic fluency (Abrahams et al., 2000). In FTD, patients with behavioural variant FTD and progressive nonfluent aphasia showed equal impairment on both phonemic and semantic fluency, with semantic dementia individuals more impaired on semantic than phonemic fluency trials (Libon et al., 2009). While studies have widely examined verbal fluency in these two groups separately, there is a lack of studies that examines these two groups concurrently.     Using the ONDRI baseline data, the present study will explore verbal fluency patterns in participants with FTD and ALS to determine whether there are similarities or differences between groups and/or disease subtypes. Although numerous studies have examined verbal fluency in FTD and ALS independently, there is a dearth of studies comparing these two groups directly. Furthermore, most studies have focused on the total number word generated, opposed to specific qualitative performance patterns (e.g., number of word generation across 15 second intervals, repetition errors, or set-loss errors). Based on the results of the proposed study we hope to further our understanding of verbal fluency performance, including initiation and maintenance patterns, as well as error characteristics. ","The primary aim of this study is to determine whether participants with FTD demonstrate similar or distinct patterns of verbal fluency to those with ALS. Based on previous literature, we anticipate a heterogeneity of performance within disease cohorts. However, it is unclear whether specific subtypes will perform similarly across diseases.  ","Clinical Platform: Disease specific history (including subtyping), demographics, and MoCA scores.     Neuropsychology Platform: Minimum dataset, plus all data variables from the DKEFS: Verbal Fluency tasks.","Using a disease agnostic approach, a cluster analysis will be conducted on the performance patterns, including: the number of words generated per 15 second interval, number of repetition errors, and number of set-loss errors across phonemic (F-A-S, or B-H-R) and semantic (animals - boys names, or clothing - girls names) fluency trials. We will use the raw scores for each participant, with age, sex, and education included in the model as covariates. Once completed, disease group and subtype will be examined to see if specific groups and/or subgroups display common clusters of performance.    In addition, we will also compare disease groups and FTD subtypes on the total number of words generated on each trial across phonemic and semantic fluency conditions using a MANOVA, with age, education, and sex included as covariates. ","The following study will increase our understanding of verbal fluency patterns in FTD and ALS. In addition, it will help to determine whether inefficiencies in verbal fluency are common or distinct across diseases and subtypes within diseases."
OND20190225MG,Maged Goubran,"Lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, and their penumbra","Previous studies have demonstrated a spectrum of white matter injury in the penumbra surrounding white matter hyperintensities.  This penumbra of microstructural injury can be quantified using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) microstructural integrity metrics and is not visible in the so called normal appearing white matter on standard structural MRI (T2/PD/FLAIR).  Although the spectrum of white matter injury has been demonstrated in the penumbra of white matter hyperintensities observed in elderly and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, this has not been examined in lacunar infarcts nor MRI-visible perivascular spaces (PVS) that are observed in various neurodegenerative disorders with comorbid cerebral small vessel disease.  Additionally, it is not known whether penumbras of white matter microstructural injury are associated with cognitive deficits.","Aim 1. To examine the microstructural integrity of the penumbra surrounding lacunes and PVS in AD/MCI, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI)  Hypothesis: After accounting for differences in age, gender, education, and vascular risk factors (eg. diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, hypertension): a) Lacunar penumbras will have poorer microstructural integrity, as indicated by lower fibre density and increased edema, compared to PVS penumbras, regardless of patient diagnosis, b) The spectrum of decline will be more gradual in the lacunar penumbra zones compared to PVS, regardless of patient diagnosis, c) The microstructural integrity in lacune & PVS penumbras will be lower in patients with a higher burden of cerebral small vessel disease (indexed by white matter hyperintensity volume).

The underlying microstructural white matter injury, measured using DTI, may be associated with subtle cognitive deficits that are observable across various neurodegenerative diseases.  Given that lacunes and PVS subcortical lesions represent small fluid-filled cavities, the surrounding penumbra may be an important target as salvageable, partially damaged, but not fully infarcted brain tissue."
OND20190304MO,Michael Ouk,Neuroprotective effects of angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) across the dementias,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease (Scheltens et al., Lancet, 2016) and the sixth most common cause of death in the United States, with a 71% increase in attributed mortality between 2000 and 2013 (Alzheimer's Association, 2016). Amyloid β (Aβ) depositions and hyperphosphorylated tau protein are key AD biomarkers, which are thought to contribute to the progression of cognitive decline and brain atrophy over time (Scheltens et al., Lancet, 2016). While existing treatments for AD, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, improve neurotransmitter function through surviving synapses, they do not slow the loss of brain tissue nor influence cortical Aβ burden (Hansen et al., Clin Interv Aging, 2008). Recent investigations have considered the importance of vascular contributions to brain atrophy, specifically the role of hypertension in progression to dementia (Perotta et al., Int J Mol Sci, 2016) and therefore the potential benefits of antihypertensive medications for the prevention or treatment of various dementias and cognitive decline (Kennelly et al., Ther Adv Neurol Disord, 2009). While the results of these studies have been variable, two drug classes which modulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have demonstrated particular relevance: Angiotensin II Type-1 Receptor Blockers (ARBs) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-Is).   Previous cross-sectional analyses suggest that ARBs may be more beneficial for slowing brain loss than ACE-Is due to neuroprotective mechanisms beyond their antihypertensive effects (Edwards et al., J Alzheimers Dis, 2017). For example, ARBs may be associated with the upregulation of Aβ catabolism and the attenuation of Aβ oligomerization, whereas ACE-Is may advance neurodegeneration by inhibiting the degradation of Aβ (Edwards et al., J Alzheimers Dis, 2017). In our own unpublished cross-sectional cohort study conducted using data from the Sunnybrook Dementia Study (SDS) database, we found that ARB users had significantly less brain atrophy indicated by cerebral ventricle volume relative to ACE-I users (p < 0.001). Ultimately, there is an urgent need for additional strategies to slow brain loss and cognitive decline in patients with or at risk for dementia. The proposed study will further validate the effects of ARBs, ACE-Is, and other antihypertensive drugs on cognitive impairment in a large cohort of subjects with VCI, MCI, and AD, and investigate for the first time the same in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), with the intention of providing clinicians with the evidence they need to choose the optimal antihypertensive medication in elderly adults at risk for cognitive decline.","The primary aim of this study is to estimate the association between the use of ARBs, ACE-Is, and other antihypertensive drugs and cognitive function/brain atrophy in subjects with VCI, MCI/AD, and PD.     Aim 1: To quantitatively assess the relationship between ARB use relative to ACE-I/other anti-hypertensive use and cognition and MRI-derived neurodegenerative biomarkers in subjects with MCI/AD.  Aim 2: To determine whether ARB use relative to ACE-I/other antihypertensive use is associated with a differential change in cognition and MRI-derived neurodegenerative biomarkers over time.  Aim 3: To explore the differential effects of ARBs and ACE-Is across patient groups with different clinical diagnoses (VCI, MCI, AD, and PD).    Hypothesis: ARB use will be associated with superior performance on tests of memory and attention/psychomotor processing speed/executive function, and with reduced global atrophy and larger hippocampal volume, relative to ACE-Is/other antihypertensive medications specifically in subjects with AD/MCI.","Imaging Variables:  •	Volumetric MRI measurements  o	i.e. whole-brain atrophy/ventricular volume, brain parenchymal fraction, hippocampal atrophy, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), perivascular spaces (PVS)    Cognitive Variables:  •	MoCA or MMSE (for non-ONDRI subjects)  •	Learning and memory i.e. RAVLT, CVLT-II, BVMT-R, other.  •	Attention/psychomotor processing speed/executive function measures i.e. TMT-A, TMT-B, DSST, WAIS-III other.

The proposed research may contribute to the growing body of evidence that suggests a role of specific antihypertensive drugs in preventing AD onset or progression independent of their blood pressure-lowering effects by affecting Aβ clearance and brain atrophy. In turn, the findings of this research could influence clinical guidelines for the prescription of antihypertensive medications to patients with cognitive impairment or AD and allow for the optimization of patient treatment.

OND20190306WS,Walter Swardfager,Oxidative lipid pathways underlying subcortical ischemic vascular disease across the dementias,"Cerebrovascular injuries have been commonly found to be co-presented in patients with different types of dementia. Oxidative stress and inflammation have been suggested to contribute to neurodegeneration. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), elevated oxidative stress markers (Schrag et al., Neurobiol Dis, 2013) and cytokines (Swardfager et al., Biol Psychiatry, 2010) are detected in peripheral blood; however, in a stratified cohort study (n=84) carefully delineating groups of patients with AD and those without AD, each containing strata of minimal and extensive subcortical small vessel injuries (SVD), we found that the peripheral oxidative stress markers were associated only with the cerebrovascular lesions, but not an AD diagnosis (Swardfager et al., Neurobiol Aging, 2017). Notably, the serum 8-isoprostane concentration was elevated in those with extensive vs. minimal SVD in (F=12.55, p=.001) but not in AD (F=0.03, p=.851). As in this cohort, the major type of cerebrovascular injuries we looked at is white matter hyperintensity (WMH), we further look into the relationship between oxidative stress markers and different types of WMH. The serum lipid hydroperoxide (LPH) concentration was associated with the volume of deep (but not periventricular) WMH, and it mediated the effect of hypertension on deep WMH volume (indirect effect 385 mm3 95% CI [47, 952] mm3).    Oxidative stress can be generated by inter-related oxidative and inflammatory pathways. These pathways are controlled, in part, by pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory oxylipin species synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (AA), and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA). For instance, the lipoxygenase (LOX)-enzyme generates many neuroactive oxylipins from LA, AA and DGLA, which might either be neurotoxic or protective against cerebrovascular injuries. Until now, the relationships between these oxylipins and subcortical SVD could not be examined in vivo. Using a novel, unique and robust UPLC-MS/MS platform, we identified relationships between higher concentrations of a LOX-derived AA metabolite, and lower concentrations of 8-isoprostane (r=-0.266, p=0.016), offering a possible explanation underlying elevated 8-isoprostanes in patients with extensive WMH; the same AA metabolite demonstrated a decreasing trend in in those extensive WMH (F=3.101, p=0.082). Another AA metabolite, derived from a different LOX isoform, was specifically lower in those with AD (F=4.98, p=0.032). The findings suggested different oxylipin pathways are compromised differentially in AD and patients with extensive SVD, which need to be confirmed in larger cohorts with more complex background. Another LOX derived LA metabolite was found to be elevated in those who have extensive WMH, accompanied by an elevating trend in a few other LOX derived LA metabolites. In those who have extensive WMH and no AD, two of the elevated LOX-derived LA metabolites were found to be neuroprotective. They were associated with lower periventricular WMH volumes (r=-0.386, p=0.042; r=-0.393, p=0.039) and with superior performance on tests of executive function (r all <0.444 and p all <.018). Our previous study also found that non-LOX-derived oxylipins detected in plasma are associated with depressive symptoms (Hennebelle et al., Psychiatry Res, 2017), which should also be assessed in studies of people with neurodegenerative disorders.  These unpublished results require confirmation in a larger sample, which also contains AD cases with various degrees of co-present cerebrovascular injuries (in particular WMH). In addition, in order to ascertain the scope of relevance and potential interaction, we would also like to explore the identified association between oxylipin signatures and cerebrovascular injuries in other neurodegenerative diagnoses, as well as the predictivity of these oxylipins in executive function decline overtime. We hypothesize that specific neuroprotective LOX-derived oxylipins will be selectively lower in people with higher periventricular WMH volumes and poorer psychomotor processing speed, attention and executive function across diagnoses; and that other LOX-derived oxylipins will be specifically lower in AD, and correlated with atrophy, hippocampal volume and memory performance in AD.","To confirm   1) the association detected between specific oxylipins and cerebrovascular injuries, and executive function decline in AD and VCI;   2) the detected association between oxylipins and neuropsychiatric symptoms.    To explore  3) the generalizability of the association between oxylipins and cerebrovascular injuries across other neurodegenerative disorders  4) the potential of baseline oxylipin levels as predictors of executive function decline and worsening of cerebrovascular injuries across neurodegenerative disorders     Aim 1.1: To confirm the association between impaired LOX derived oxylipin metabolism, cerebrovascular injuries (particularly the volume of WMHs) and executive function decline in the VCI cohort and AD cohort.  Aim 1.2: To explore the potential associations between oxylipins and cortical atrophy, hippocampal volume, and memory performance in AD.  Aim 1.3: To explore relationships between LOX-mediated oxylipins and OCT phenotypes in the AD and VCI cohorts, as well as the potential interaction between OCT phenotypes and cerebral vascular injuries.  Aim 1.4: To explore the impact of AD risk genes (Karch et al., Neuron, 2014; Stage et al., Alzheimers Dement (Amst), 2016) on the associations among oxylipins, WMH, atrophy, and cognitive function.    Aim 2.1: To explore the relationships between oxylipins and neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g. NPI scores, BIS/BAS scores, Cornell scores) in patients with different types neurodegenerative disorders.  Aim 2.2: To explore the potential impact of genetic risk scores, OCT phenotypes and cerebrovascular injuries on the association between neuropsychiatric symptoms and non-LOX derived oxylipins.     Aim 3.1: To explore the association between impaired oxylipin metabolism, cerebrovascular injuries, and executive function deficits across the cohorts.  Aim 3.2: To explore the association between impairment of specific oxylipin levels, cortical atrophy, and executive function deficits across the cohorts.      Aim 4.1: To examine if baseline oxylipins levels could predict over time decline in executive function in patients with heterogenous neurodegenerative disorders.  Aim 4.2: To examine if baseline oxylipins levels could foresee enlargement of WMH and PVS in patients with neurodegenerative disorders over time.  Aim 4.3: To investigate baseline oxylipins as predictors of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative disorders.     Hypothesis:   The LA oxylipins will be elevated in VCI patients and positively associated with executive functions and volume of white matter lesions. The associations will sustain across different disease cohorts.   The non-LOX derived oxylipins will be associated with psychiatric symptoms across different disease cohorts.   The baseline LA oxylipin levels would be predictive of over-time executive function decline and enlargement of white matter hyperintensities while the baseline non-LOX-derived oxylipins would be predictive of psychiatric symptoms.

OND20190313YD,Youness Demnati,Motor Asymmetry as a Biomarker of Parkinson's Disease Progression    ,"Motor asymmetry has been prominently characterized in patients with Parkinson's Disease on a clinical basis (ie. the UPDRS and the Hoehn and Yahr Scale). Clinical evaluation of motor asymmetry is directly related to disease severity in Parkinson's Disease. However, functional asymmetry, characterized by static and dynamic balance control (i.e. quiet standing and walking), in this cohort is less reported. Both clinical and functional asymmetries are important for patient care, however, it is unknown if these approaches differ with respect to asymmetry characterization. The objective of this study is to compare clinical and functional motor asymmetries as they manifest with Parkinson's Disease severity and to determine whether the selection of task challenges is important in revealing functional asymmetry.","1.	In the literature, early clinical symptoms of PD (e.g. limb rigidity) present asymmetrically with one side of the body more affected than the other, becoming more symmetric as the disease progresses. We look to examine whether clinical asymmetry (scored on the UPDRS and the Hoehn and Yahr) and functional asymmetry (i.e. static postural balance control and gait) are correlated with PD severity.  Hypotheses:   a)	Clinical asymmetry (defined by scores on the UPDRS Section 3 Unilateral Motor Tests) will be negatively correlated with disease severity (as defined by the UPDRS total score and the Hoehn and Yahr Score).   b)	Functional asymmetry (as defined by centre of pressure excursions during standard stance and narrow stance tasks and walking and dual task walking tasks) will be negatively correlated with disease severity.    2.	In the literature, clinical asymmetry in PD is measured as impaired control of the affected side.  In contrast, functional asymmetry is commonly expressed as a change in behaviour (e.g. the favouring of the less affected side) presumed to be associated with the severity of impaired control of the clinically more affected side. We look to examine the relationship between clinical asymmetry (i.e. the UPDRS Section 3 Unilateral Motor Tests) and functional asymmetry (i.e. static postural balance control and step characteristics during walking).  Hypothesis:   a)	Functional [1] standard stance asymmetry and functional [2] walking gait asymmetry will be negatively correlated to clinical asymmetry, as defined by the UPDRS Section 3 Unilateral Motor Tests.   b)	Functional [3] narrow stance asymmetry and functional [4] dual task walking gait asymmetry will be positively correlated with clinical asymmetry, as defined by the UPDRS Section 3 Unilateral Motor Tests.     3.	In the literature, there are reports which indicate that the functional asymmetry exhibited by early stage PD patients is often a compensatory stability strategy, in which the patients favour the less affected limb to compensate for the lack of control in their more affected limb. Selection of task challenges to limit behavioural compensation and expose physiological stability impairments is important to allow the use of functional balance measures as a biomarker of instability and risk of falling in the PD cohort. We look to examine whether task conditions of varying difficulty will expose different stability challenges in the PD cohort.   Hypothesis:   Within each clinical stage of PD, we hypothesize that the patients who exhibit more asymmetry in the:   a)	Standard stance condition will be more stable than the patients who are more symmetric in the standard stance condition.   b)	Narrow stance condition will be less stable than the patients who are more symmetric in the narrow stance condition.  c)	Walking condition will be more stable than the patients who are more symmetric in the walking condition.   d)	Dual task walking condition will be less stable than the patients who are more symmetric in the dual task walking condition.","Clinical platform data:   1.

Understanding the relationship between clinical and functional motor asymmetry may increase our ability of characterizing the balance, mobility, and stability impairments within this cohort. Furthermore, understanding the functional task conditions required to exploit the stability anomalies this cohort may have would help to drive the development of the physical tools needed to help these patients gain more stability in every-day challenging task conditions."
OND20190326KS,Komal Shaikh,Sleep Quality in MCI/AD,"Sleep fragmentation and reduced duration are common disturbances reported in normal aging. Mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease are associated with similar yet more severe sleep disturbances. Sleep disruptions are common in dementia and may lead to worsening memory because of interrupted memory consolidation during sleep. Recent research suggests that sleep quality plays a critical role in preserving cognitive function and reducing the risk of dementia (Landry & Liu-Ambrose, 2014).  Sleep quality also seems to differ between men and women, with women reporting greater complaints regarding sleep quality and an increased prevalence of sleep disorders during specific time points, such as menopause (Mallampalli & Carter, 2014). We are proposing several studies, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, that examine the utility of sleep quality in predicting the development of AD in those initially identified with MCI. ","The primary aim is to understand the clinical utility of sleep quality in individuals with MCI and AD. Specific aims include the following:  1.	We will explore sex differences in sleep quality within MCI and AD populations.    2.	We will explore the relationship between sleep quality and measures of cognition (memory and attention) in MCI and AD populations.   3.	We will investigate the relationship between sleep quality and quality of life and instrumental activities of daily living  4.	We will investigate additional factors, including genetics and cognitive reserve, that may act as moderators of the relationship between sleep quality and dementia.   5.	We will investigate the sensitivity of sleep quality in discriminating between participants with MCI who later develop AD versus those who remain stable with MCI.     ","•	Participant demographic information, particularly sex and years of education     •	Questionnaires: Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, World Health Organization Quality of Life   •	Neuropsychological test data: Associative memory, WAIS Digit Span, Trail making test, face-name association test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test  •	Neuropsychiatric: Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living   •	Medical Records: history of sleep disorders ","Analyses for each of the aims include:  1.	We will perform a two-way ANOVA with sex and sleep quality as independent variables and dementia severity as a dependent variable.   2.	We will calculate a correlation to see if better sleep quality is associated with better performance on cognitive measures, within MCI and AD groups.  3.	We will perform correlational analyses between sleep quality, quality of life and instrumental activities of daily living.   4.	We will perform a regression analysis with cognitive reserve (as indicated by years of education) as moderator variables and sleep quality (at baseline) as a predictor variable for group membership at subsequent follow-ups. 5.	We will perform a regression analysis with sleep quality (at baseline) as a predictor variable for group membership at subsequent follow-ups.   ","Understanding how sleep quality varies in different stages of AD may lead to better clinical assessment and diagnosis (particularly for early-stage disease) and may help with the development of targeted interventions (e.g., sleep interventions)"
OND20190401AK,Arunima Kapoor,Deciphering Clinically Meaningful Change on Cognitive Measures in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"In the coming year, approximately 103,000 Canadians will develop dementia, primarily due to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), Parkinson's disease (PD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Cognitive impairment represents one of the most debilitating features of a neurodegenerative disease and is often used as a surrogate of disease progression. While numerous neuropsychological tests exist to assess and follow deterioration, improvement or stability in cognition over time, little is known about what constitutes a clinically meaningful change on such measures. Clinically important difference is often defined using a distribution-based approach, with a change equivalent to one-half standard deviation or one standard error of measurement being considered clinically meaningful. However, whether such changes on neuropsychological assessments represent a change in functional and patient-centered outcomes remains unknown. ","The primary purpose of this is study to (1) evaluate whether neuropsychological assessment scores correlate with functional and patient-centered outcomes in the VCI cohort, (2) evaluate whether change in neuropsychological assessment scores correlates with changes in functional and patient-centered outcomes and establish a clinically meaningful change, (3) identify neuropsychological measures that are most sensitive to and predictive of functional change, and (4) examine whether clinically meaningful change on neuropsychological assessments varies between men and women ","Participant Demographics: age, sex, level of education, disease specific history, ethnicity    Neuropsychology Minimum Dataset     Functional Outcomes: Modified Rankin Scale, Sheehan Disability Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life","Based on neuropsychological assessments at 1 and 2 year follow-up, change in neuropsychological assessment measures and functional outcome measures will be calculated. Linear regression analyses, controlling for age, sex and education, will be run to examine the relationship between change in neuropsychological measures and functional outcomes. Finally, differences in clinically meaningful change between men and women will be explored. We will first run this analysis within the VCI cohort and then potentially expand this proposal to include all disease cohorts.","Given that notable change in outcome is currently determined based on statistical significance, this study has the potential to impact how outcome measures are analyzed, and to elucidate clinically meaningful change on commonly used outcome scales in clinical trials."
OND20190405AB,Amin Banihashemi,Eye-brain cholinergic system correlation (I),"Summary - The main focus of this proposal is to investigate the relationship of the volume of the eye's cholinergically active retinal layers - namely the ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and inner nuclear layer (INL) - with the volume of one of the brain's cholinergically active centers, the nucleus basal of Meynert (nbM), which supplies cholinergic innervation to the cognitively important structures of neocortex, hippocampus and amygdala.     Rationale-    Volume of brain cholinergic structures may aid in predicting cognitive decline and axial instability - The brain's cholinergic system is important as it enables control of cognitive processes such as attention and memory. Cholinergic signals are transmitted by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Most cholinergic neurons in mammals are found in four brain regions. Of these four regions, the basal forebrain region houses four cholinergic nuclei itself, one of which is of interest in this proposal. This nucleus of interest is the Ch4 nuclei known as the nucleus basalis of Meynert (Ballinger, Ananth, Talmage, & Role, 2016). The atrophy of the nbM, and structures innervated by it such as neocortex and hippocampus, has been well-documented in dementias (Barkhof & van Buchem, 2016; Staffaroni et al., 2017). Volume loss in nbM identifies individual at risk of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Brueggen et al., 2015) and Parkinson disease (PD) (Schulz, Pagano, Fernandez Bonfante, Wilson, & Politis, 2018). The diagnostic accuracy of nbM volume is actually more than the well-studied hippocampal volume in distinguishing AD from prodromal AD state (Kilimann et al., 2014). The disruption of cholinergic innervation from nbM to other brain regions by cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) also contributes to cognitive decline (Jaswal et al., 2018; McNeely et al., 2015). We will be taking SVD into account in this proposal as it contributes to cognitive decline in AD (Roseborough, Ramirez, Black, & Edwards, 2017), vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and vascular dementia (VaD) (Mesulam, Siddique, & Cohen, 2003), and possibly PD (Schwartz, Halliday, Soh, Cordato, & Kril, 2018). Early detection of brain cholinergic disruption as a sign of impeding cognitive decline is valued as there is trend to offer disease modifying treatments under active investigation in the pre-clinical stage of cognitive decline in the hopes of their greater efficacy (Cummings, Lee, Ritter, & Zhong, 2018; Lang & Espay, 2018; Ngandu et al., 2015). Early cholinergic deterioration detection may also identify individuals with PD at risk of fall as the cholinergic system plays a role for mobility in PD, especially in falls (Kucinski & Sarter, 2015; Morris et al., 2019; Muller et al., 2015). Whether in aiding in identifying at-risk individuals for cognitive decline or falls, decision making to enrol in a clinical trial of disease modifying interventions or initiating treatments to increase cholinergic supply in the brain to provide modest symptomatic benefit, there is value in a time- and cost-saving approach in detecting brain cholinergic deterioration, preferably in its earliest stages. As discussed below, eye biomarkers are good candidates for this purpose.    Small vessel disease disrupts cholinergic flow from nbM to cortex - In addition to nbM volume loss and degeneration SVD also disrupts the neuronal projections from nbM, which supply the brain with cholinergic input. We will use developed and validated brain masks from our lab (McNeely et al., 2015) that quantify the volume of SVD parameters, such as white matter hyperintensities and lacunes, in certain parts of the lateral pathway of nbM neuronal projections. We will not be measuring the volume of the actual neuronal projections themselves.    Retinal biomarkers may detect brain states in a cost- and time-saving manner- The eye's retina is frequently studied as a representation of brain neuronal development and pathology. Furthermore, eye imaging and image analysis is less costly and quicker than brain imaging and neuropsychological testing. As such, should the proposed eye retinal biomarkers correlate with brain biomarkers such as nbM volume, these eye biomarkers can potentially detect brain cholinergic deterioration in a cost- and time-saving manner in all three disease platforms. Should a correlation not be found, this can lead to further investigation as to why the eye is not impacted like the brain in these disease states.    The eye's retina and brain share embryological origins - The eye's retina is frequently used as a model of neuronal development and pathology in lieu of brain tissue. Based on lower vertebrate studies during embryogenesis, the forebrain is formed from the anterior neuroectoderm which gives rise to the telencephalon, eyes, hypothalamus and diencephalon. As such the eye and the brain derive from the same embryonic tissue and remain connected (Wilson & Houart, 2004).     The eye's retina and brain share neurotransmitters - The cholinergic neurotransmitter acetylcholine which is produced in nbM is also produced by a subset of retinal cells called the starburst amacrine cells. Acetylcholine is depleted in cognitive decline, particularly in AD and PD (Ballinger et al., 2016) and in the retina it modulates detection of directional motion (Balasubramanian & Gan, 2014). These acetylcholine producing retinal cells are mostly located in INL, near its border with IPL, and smaller population are in the GCL. The projections of these amacrine cells travel to the IPL where they contribute to IPL's synaptic structure (Balasubramanian & Gan, 2014). The neurotransmitter dopamine which is involved in motor behaviour, reward circuitry, cognition and emotional states that is depleted in the brain in PD is also produced by another subset of amacrine cells. These dopaminergic amacrine cells are at the border of INL and IPL. Dopamine is also depleted in PD in the retina. (Witkovsky, 2004). Dopamine modulates light adaptation and circadian rhythm in the retina (Balasubramanian & Gan, 2014). While the IPL and GCL are of most interest, the INL will also be assessed in this proposal.    The eye's retina and brain share signs of pathology - Pathological toxic misfolded proteins such as amyloid, tau and alpha-synuclein observed in different brain regions in AD and PD have also been observed in the retina (den Haan et al., 2018; Veys et al., 2019), particularly in the INL, IPL and GCL. Interestingly, these are the same cholinergic and dopaminergic retinal layers discussed earlier. While these toxic proteins may not be causative for these diseases (Espay et al., 2019), their co-existence in the retina and brain may indicate a similar environment in both. As an example brain amyloid accumulation is a hallmark of disease progression in AD and its correlation with eye biomarkers has been studied. In at-risk individuals with positive amyloid imaging, the retina's IPL volume appears to increase in volume (Snyder et al., 2016) in an 18 month period when compared to those with negative amyloid imaging. In contrast to at-risk populations, when AD or PD has already been diagnosed, both IPL and GCL appear to have decreased volume at baseline (Garcia-Martin et al., 2016; Veys et al., 2019). Taken together, there is reason to believe that retinal biomarkers may correlate brain pathology.    Summary - The main focus of this proposal is to investigate the relationship of the volume of the eye's cholinergically active retinal layers - namely the ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and inner nuclear layer (INL) - with the volume of one of the brain's cholinergically active centers, the nucleus basal of Meynert (nbM), which supplies cholinergic innervation to the cognitively important structures of neocortex, hippocampus and amygdala.

Taken together, there is reason to believe that retinal biomarkers may correlate brain pathology.  Why study AD/MCI, PD and VCI/VaD? As mentioned earlier, cholinergic deterioration in all three disease states has been observed. This is unlike other ONDRI disease platforms such as FTD and ALS. While in AD/MCI and PD groups this brain cholinergic deterioration is attributed to degeneration of the nbM itself, this is less so in VCI/VaD (Jung et al., 2012; Mesulam et al., 2003) where, at least in its pure form, cholinergic supply disruption is due to the adverse impact of SVD on neuronal projections providing cholinergic supply to the neocortex, hippocampus and other brain regions.  Cholinergic deterioration appears to be greater in PD relative to AD as nbM volume loss on neuroimaging , and neuronal loss on histopathology (Candy et al., 1983) seems to be greatest in PD. Response to treatments aimed at increasing the brain's cholinergic supply seem to be greater in PD as well (Ballinger et al., 2016). It is not certain if SVD prevalence in PD is less or comparable to other disease platforms (Schwartz, Halliday, Cordato, & Kril, 2012). We make these assumptions about the degree of deterioration in each disease being mindful that these neurodegenerative diseases are heterogeneous in nature (Espay, Brundin, & Lang, 2017; Lam, Masellis, Freedman, Stuss, & Black, 2013) and that each ONDRI disease platform of interest likely has a mix of pathologies associated with AD, VaD, SVD, and PD. Taken together, the AD/MCI, PD and VCI/VaD disease platforms benefit most from detection of cholinergic deterioration.","Aims for each ONDRI disease platform (AD/MCI, PD and VCI/VaD) for all participants at baseline.    Primary aim:     (1) Investigate the relationship of GCL, IPL, INL and whole retinal volumes and thickness with nbM volume.    Secondary aims:     (1) Investigate the relationship of GCL, IPL, INL and whole retinal volumes and thickness, nbM volume, and white matter hyperintensity and lacunar stroke volumes in cortical projections of nbM with domain-specific aggregate scores of cognition and motor score.    (2) Investigate the relationship of GCL, IPL, INL and whole retinal volumes and thickness with hippocampal volume.    (3) Investigate the relationship of GCL, IPL, INL and whole retinal volumes and thickness with cortical volume and thickness.     (4) Investigate the relationship of basal forebrain sub-regions with the volumes of their target cortical region volume and thickness and hippocampal volume.","Basic demographics, APOE E4 allele carrier status, neuropsychological tests to calculate domain specific aggregate scores, brain extraction masks, SABRE generated brain MRI parameters, SD-OCT volume and thickness of whole retina, GCL, IPL, and INL.","Data extraction - To investigate our hypotheses, we will extract the needed information from readily available ONDRI data such as whole retinal and brain and hippocampal volumes or as follows:     Eye imaging    - Volume of retinal layers: will be extracted from retinal images obtained by Optical Coherence Tomography using the automatic segmentation algorithm of the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT equipment used in ONDRI. This automatic segmentation has excellent correlation with manual segmentation (Wong et al., 2017). All measurements are at the macula centered on the fovea. Whole retina is from the inner limiting membrane to the Bruch's membrane. The IPL and GCL are of greater interest, in that order, than INL, as they have been shown to undergo more changes in dementia based on a review of literature.    Brain imaging    Approval for methodological development - We will submit an application for the approval of methodological development for using brain atlases for the measurement of the volume of the nbM if required. Image analysis will be contingent upon the release of T1 images from ONDRI. None of these image segmentations are being introduced/integrated into the SABRE output that is standard for ONDRI, but the results of segmentation will be shared with the NIBS platform. The methods used for these segmentations have already been published as cited below in each section.    - Volume of nbM: will be measured in vivo using a readily available and validated brain mask atlas using established methods from a collaborating lab. The methods paper can be found here (Kilimann et al., 2014) with a detailed explanation of its implementation found here (M. J. Grothe, Kilimann, Grinberg, Heinsen, & Teipel, 2018). The processing pipeline is based on a 'voxel-based morphometry' approach, combined with VBM8-type tissue segmentation and high-dimensional spatial normalization using SPM's DARTEL algorithm (M. J. Grothe et al., 2018). The result will yield: (1) one merged subdivision of Ch1-2 of the basal forebrain, which innervates the hippocampal complex, (2) the Ch3 division, which innervates the olfactory bulb, and (3) the Ch4 (nbM) subdivisions (posterior, combined anterior and intermediate, and one other subdivision), which innervate the cortex and amygdala (M. J. Grothe et al., 2018; Liu, Chang, Pearce, & Gentleman, 2015).    - SVD: White matter hyperintensities and lacune volumes in select cholinergic pathways will be measured using an automated processing pipeline developed in our lab. The methods paper for this pipeline and its brain mask are published and can be found here (McNeely et al., 2015). In the automated method volumes are reported unweighted for the two divisions of the lateral pathways with those below the temporal lobe not included, as MRI visualization is difficult in this area. The two divisions include the capsular division of the external capsule and uncinate fasciculus and the perisylvian division within the claustrum (Selden, Gitelman, Salamon-Murayama, Parrish, & Mesulam, 1998). The medial pathway through the cingulum was not included as WMH are uncommon in this area. This automated method based on an earlier manual visual rating system weighted by distance from nbM which estimated the severity of these WMH in the medial and lateral pathways. The methods paper for this manual visual rating can be found here (Bocti et al., 2005). Greater weight is given to projections proximal to nbM with decreased weight for more distal projections in the manual method.   Clinical assessments    Neurobehavioral and clinical assessments    - Cognitive scores: composite z-scores of select neuropsychological tests representing cognitive functions associated with brain cholinergic system based on prior work from our lab (Jaswal et al., 2018; McNeely et al., 2015) and in consultation with ONDRI's Neuropsychological platform will be calculated (Appendix A). These aggregate scores are based on the mean and standard deviation of the patient data to determine how many standard deviations a patient's cognitive score is from the sample's mean. Domains included are: General cognitive domain function, Language, Visuospatial, Memory, Attention/working memory, and Executive function.     - Motor scores: Scores included in the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) will also be used in PD. The Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&Y scale), motor score, indices of postural instability and fall history are of particular interest. H&Y scale is reported in 0.5 increments as a stand-alone assessment and in 1.0 increments as part of the MDS-UPDRS.     Statistical analysis     Comparisons between diagnostic groups will be assessed using ANOVA for continuous variables and chi square for categorical variables. Association of eye and brain parameters with each other and with cognition scores will be assessed using linear regression. Brain nbM volumes will be corrected by dividing their value by total intracranial volumes. Retinal layer volumes will also be divided by total retinal volume and reported as a ratio. These ratios will be used in reporting and analysis.     As an example, in one regression model we will investigate the association of IPL/GCL volume (as independent variable) with nbM volume (as dependent variable) adjusted for cholinergic projection SVD, diagnosis, age, sex and APOE E4 allele carrier status. In a separate regression model, we will investigate the association of IPL/GCL volume (as independent variable) with composite z-scores (as dependent variable) adjusted for cholinergic projection SVD, diagnosis, age, sex and APOE E4 allele carrier status, and education. Other aims will be assessed in a similar fashion.    Comparison to normal controls - As ONDRI does not include normal controls, we will use available data from literature for a qualitative comparison with normal nbM volume (M. Grothe, Heinsen, & Teipel, 2012; Ray et al., 2018), retinal volumes (Garcia-Martin et al., 2016).    Expected results     We anticipate IPL/GCL volumes will correlate with nbM volume in AD/MCI, PD and VCI/VaD ONDRI disease platforms. Less nbM volume is expected to be present in both AD and PD, with PD being more pronounced. As ONDRI's VCI/VaD contains mixed AD and VaD disease cases we expect some nbM volume loss in this groups as well, but we expect this to be less than either AD or PD.     We anticipate less IPL/GCL retinal layer volumes, less nbM volumes and greater SVD on nbM neuronal projections to significantly correlate with lower domain-specific aggregate scores of cognition in all three ONDRI disease platforms, AD/MCI, PD and VCI/VaD, and higher motor score, and more falls in PD. Disruption of nbM neuronal projections is expected in AD and VaD as small vessel disease is a large contributor to either disease, but we except this to be less pronounced in PD due to possibly less small vessel disease.     We anticipate less volume in each basal forebrain sub-region to correlate with less volume of its target cortical structure.     Shortcomings     As the disease states being studied have multiple pathologies, some of the effect of volume loss in the retina, particularly in the GCL, may be independent of considered pathologies or cholinergic degeneration. As an example, the GCL layer may undergo retrograde degeneration due to lesions such as stroke in the visual pathway (Dinkin, 2017). The effect of SVD on the visual pathway had not been studied to date.    Future directions - While initial assessment is based on baseline ONDRI data, further exploration with longitudinal data may better identify those at risk of cognitive decline and fall risk. ","Dementia is one of ten leading causes of death in Canada (StatCan, 2018). Delaying dementia's onset by just 2 years can decrease its incidence by 19% and its economic burden by $218 B in the next 30 years (Alzheimer Society of Canada, 2010; Smetanin et al., 2009). This has led Canada to adopt a national strategy to address this burden (Ogilvie & Eggleton, 2016). While disease modifying therapies do not yet accommodate the heterogeneity of dementing diseases observed in clinical practice, detecting dementia's underlying disease process leading to cognitive impairment early appears to be important. With axial impairment being a major cause of disability in PD (Koller, Glatt, Vetere-Overfield, & Hassanein, 1989; Muslimovic et al., 2008), detecting those at risk of falls early may also aid in its prevention.     We intend to make early detection of individuals at risk of cognitive decline or fall quicker and less expensive by examining a novel eye biomarker to detect brain cholinergic degeneration. "
OND20190507KF,Keera Fishman,Bilingualism in Parkinson's disease: Help or hindrance on cognition and quality of life?,"Though studies have illustrated associations between neuropathological changes (e.g., brain atrophy, cerebral blood flow, post-mortem brain tissue) and cognitive impairment, there remains great individual variability in the manifestation and strength of these observed relationships. The cognitive reserve (CR) hypothesis seeks to explain the differential susceptibility of individuals to functional impairment in the presence of pathology and/or other neurological insults (Barulli & Stern, 2013). CR factors including educational attainment, occupational complexity, physical activity, social engagement, volunteerism, and socioeconomic status, have been investigated as contributors to preserving cognitive functioning in older adults (Cosentino & Stern, 2013; Darwish, Farran, Assaad, & Chaaya, 2018; Koenen, et al., 2009; Opdebeeck et al., 2016; Reed et al., 2011; Sattler, Toro, Schönknecht, & Schröder, 2012; Schwingel, Niti, Tang, & Ng, 2009; Whalley, Deary, Appleton, & Starr, 2004).  The growing scientific literature suggests that bilingualism, characterized as the regular use of two languages, may also contribute to cognitive reserve (Bialystok et al., 2011; Whitaker et al., 2014). Bilingualism has been shown to impact cognition across the lifespan (Bialystok, Craik, Green, & Gollan, 2009; Bialystok, Craik, & Luk, 2012; Grosjean, 1989; Luk, Green, Abutalebi, & Grady, 2012). For example, bilingual individuals have been shown to outperform monolingual individuals (those who speak only one language) on tests of executive functioning, encompassing attentional control, inhibition, task switching, and cognitive flexibility, in early childhood, adulthood, and later adulthood (Bialystok, 2011; Bialystok, Martin, & Viswanathan, 2005; Christoffels, Haan, Steenbergen, van den Wildenberg, & Colzato, 2015). While bilingual children and adults also experience better metalinguistic awareness and non-verbal spatial abilities than monolinguals (Bialystok et al., 2010; Bialystok & Luk, 2011; Galambos & Goldin-Meadow, 1990), they often have poorer verbal skills (e.g., vocabulary size) and slower response speed on tasks of verbal comprehension (Ransdell & Fischler, 1987) and production (Ivanova & Costa, 2008). Abutalebi and Green (2008) proposed a neurocognitive model of bilingual language switching, whereby they highlighted the critical roles of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, and bilateral supramarginal gyri in bilingual language switching.  Apart from the Alzheimer's dementia literature, there is limited research evaluating the role of bilingualism on the cognitive abilities of individuals and the onset of cognitive symptoms affected by other common neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is caused primarily by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway, resulting in a reduction of dopamine levels in the striatum, and impacting fronto-striatal networks dedicated to motor, cognitive, affective, and motivational functions (Alexander, Crutcher, & de Long; 1990; Alexander, de Long, Strick, 1986). Parkinson's disease is characterized by motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability) and a broad spectrum of non-motor features, including sleep, sensory, cognitive (including language), and affective disturbances (Muslimović, 2009; Poewe, 2006). Cognitive dysfunction in PD ranges from 36% at the time of diagnosis to 93% in more advanced disease stages (Foltynie, Brayne, Robbins, & Barker, 2004; Pirozzolo, Hansch, Mortimer, Webster, & Kuskowski, 1982). Cognitive impairment in PD can affect a variety of domains, including executive functioning, complex attention, memory, visuospatial abilities, language, and working memory (Dubois & Pillon, 1997; Farina et al., 2000; Stefanova, Kostic, Ziropadja, Ocic, & Markovic, 2001; Taylor, Saint-Cyr, & Lang, 1986; Uc, Rizzo, Anderson, Qian, Rodnitzky, & Dawson, 2005). However, PD is marked primarily by deficits in executive functioning, in contrast to AD, where the primary and predominant impairment is in memory (Williams-Gray et al., 2009). Executive functions refer to an array of skills involving the initiation, planning, and monitoring of goal-directed behaviours (Muslimović, 2009). These mental abilities are commonly associated with the functional integrity of neural circuits that connect the basal ganglia with frontal cortical regions, specifically, the dorsolateral circuit (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral caudate, dorsomedial globus pallidus, and thalamus) and anterior cingulate circuit (i.e., anterior cingulate area, ventral striatum, lateral globus pallidus, and thalamus; Alexander et al., 1986; Chudasama & Robbins, 2006). Impairment of EF in PD may also adversely affect quality of life, caregiver burden, and insight into functional limitations (Kudlicka, Claire, & Hindle, 2013a; Kudlicka, Clare & Hindle, 2013b).  If a bilingual advantage is mediated through changes in executive functioning, this effect is appropriate to be explored in conditions, such as PD, where executive functions are commonly compromised. To the best of our knowledge, only one previous study has examined the role of bilingualism on cognition in PD. Hindle et al. (2015) compared monolinguals and bilinguals with PD on EF and language tasks. Hindle et al. (2015) found that monolinguals (n = 57) performed better than bilinguals (n = 46) on language tasks (i.e., National Adult Reading Test-Revised and British Picture Vocabulary Scale), but there was no difference in executive functioning performance of monolinguals and bilinguals. However, they did find that a higher degree of bilingualism (i.e., dividing the proportion of pictures named correctly in the language producing a lower naming score by the proportion of pictures named correctly in the language with the higher naming score on the Boston Naming Test) correlated with performance on a working memory and nonverbal reasoning task. Although this study appropriately examined differences in clinical and demographic variables (e.g., age, socioeconomic status, education, time since diagnosis, age at diagnosis, motor severity) across monolinguals and bilinguals, this study exclusively included individuals with early PD, only examined the cognitive domains of language and executive function, and did not evaluate the number of years living in Canada or year of language acquisition.  Using the ONDRI baseline data, the current study will explore differences between monolingual and bilingual performance using the minimum neuropsychology dataset. Our study has three primary goals: 1) to evaluate the impact of bilingualism on cognitive abilities in PD, 2) to determine whether bilingualism impacts self- and informant-report of decline of cognitive symptoms in PD, and 3) to clarify whether monolinguals and bilinguals differ in functional abilities or self-reported quality of life independent of cognition. As a result, the current study aims to expand on Hindle et al.'s (2015) study by including a larger cohort of individuals with PD, including individuals with a range of global cognitive functioning, and evaluating cognition across a variety of domains including EF, language, memory, visual-spatial ability, working memory, and attention. We will also conduct secondary analyses to evaluate possible clinical and demographic differences, including Full Scale Intelligence Quotient-2 (FSIQ-2), age, years of education, time since diagnosis, medical history, motor severity, number of years living in Canada, and primary language (i.e., L1 versus L2). We will also evaluate the impact of the degree of bilingualism (e.g., balanced versus unbalanced) on neuropsychological performance. Lastly, we will evaluate possible influences of bilingualism on functional ability and quality of life.  Bilingualism will be measured using a modified version of the Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q). Consistent with Bialystok et al. (2007), Craik et al. (2010), and Chertkow et al. (2010), bilingualism will be defined as: 'spending the majority of their lives, at least since early adulthood, regularly using at least two languages.' Monolinguals will speak English only, whereas bilinguals will speak English and at least one other language.","Consistent with previous literature in healthy older adults, we hypothesize that bilinguals with PD will perform significantly better on tests of executive function and working memory, and worse on language and processing speed tasks, than monolinguals with PD. We also hypothesize that monolinguals and bilinguals will perform similarly on measures of memory and visual-spatial ability. Furthermore, given the proposed role of bilingualism as a contributor to cognitive reserve, we propose that bilinguals will report better quality of life and better functional abilities compared to monolinguals, after controlling for age, gender, years of education, and years since PD diagnosis.","Clinical Platform: Disease specific history (including subtyping), demographics, questionnaires, and MoCA scores.   Neuropsychology Platform: Minimum dataset.  ","We will conduct one-way MANCOVAs to examine whether languages used (i.e., monolingualism versus bilingualism, as assessed using a modified version of the Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire [LEAP-Q]) impacts (1) language ability (i.e., Test of Adolescent/Adult Verbal Naming, Boston Naming Test, WASI-II Vocabulary, Semantic Probe) (2) executive function (i.e., Trail Making Test - Part B, DKEFS Stroop incongruent colour naming (condition 3) and switching (condition 4), Semantic Fluency, Phonemic Fluency), (3) Attention and working memory (i.e., WAIS-III digit span), (4) Processing speed (i.e., DKEFS Stroop colour naming (condition 1) and word naming (condition 2), Trail Making Test-A, Symbol-Digit Modalities Test) (5) Memory (i.e., Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised), and (6) visual-spatial ability (i.e., Judgment of Line Orientation, VOSP: Incomplete letters), after controlling for age, gender, and years of education, in individuals with PD. Complementing this analysis (and pending our sample size is adequate), we will also separate our bilingual group into balanced and unbalanced bilinguals to examine if one group (e.g., balanced bilinguals, defined as LI/L2 same age of acquisition and proficiency, and frequency of use) are driving the effects as hypothesized, if an effect is observed.    Consistent with previous literature in healthy older adults, we hypothesize that bilinguals with PD will perform significantly better on tests of executive function, working memory, and visuospatial reasoning, and worse on language, verbal fluency, and processing speed tasks. We believe monolinguals and bilinguals will perform similarly on measures of memory.    We will conduct a one-way MANOVA to evaluate the impact of number of languages used (i.e., monolingualism versus bilingualism: independent variable) on cognitive decline over time (i.e., 10 years) using the self-report and other-report short-form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (Short IQCODE) as dependent variables.     Within the bilingual sample, we will also conduct a multiple hierarchical linear regression to determine whether the age of second language learned, frequency of language use, proficiency of speaking language, proficiency of understanding language, and number of years living in Canada, can predict performance on the neuropsychological measures (adapted version of the LEAP-Q; Marian et al., 2007), consistent with Yow & Li (2015) and recommended by Mindt et al. (2008).     We will also conduct a one-way MANCOVA to evaluate whether bilinguals report better quality of life (i.e., WHO-QoL-BREF) and functional abilities (i.e., PDQ-39, Schwab & England, iADLs scale) than monolinguals. Given the proposed role of bilingualism as a contributor to cognitive reserve, we hypothesize that bilinguals will report greater wellbeing and better functional abilities compared to monolinguals, after controlling for age, gender, and years of education.    Consistent with Hindle et al. (2015), chi-square and ANOVA tests also will be used to evaluate potential differences between monolinguals and bilinguals, including age of disease onset, disease duration, years of education, intellectual functioning (FSIQ-2) mood (i.e., Generalized Anxiety Disorders Assessment [GAD-R] and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology [QIDS]), MoCA, and years living in Canada.   ","The following study will expand on our understanding of the role of bilingualism on executive functioning, language, and memory, in PD. It will also help to elucidate any impact of bilingualism on quality of life and functional abilities independent of cognitive status."
OND20190513SB,Saba Samet,Optical coherence tomography as a biomarker for disease severity and central nervous system pathology in ALS,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by a swift progression of neurodegeneration with a mean survival time of 3-4 years, affecting 0.5-3.6/100,000 of people worldwide (1). The disease affects motor neurons in the primary motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord, and results in both upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs (2). The underlying pathophysiology is not well understood, yet the pathology and clinical expression has been shown to extend further to the extramotor nervous system (3,4). The development of disease biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognostication in ALS has become an important area of research.   Conventional neuroimaging techniques such as standard CT or MRI evaluation do not demonstrate gross structural brain changes in ALS. Advanced MRI techniques however allow for investigation of the nervous system for atrophy and alterations in microstructure (5). These tools have allowed for unprecedented in vivo neuropathological study of the brain in ALS. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) uses specific MRI acquisition sequences focused on the directionality of water movement (6). DTI exposes alterations in the degree and directedness (mean diffusivity, MD, and fractional anisotropy, FA, respectively) of proton movement in order to investigate the integrity of white matter tracts (5,6). Using DTI, the corticospinal tract (CST) has been found to be mainly and early affected along the disease course (7,8), and the middle posterior body of the corpus callosum demonstrates substantial reductions in FA (9-11). The frontal lobes, basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem and cervical spinal cord have further been shown to be involved with DTI studies (12-14). These results have demonstrated that abnormal pathologic outcomes in ALS are not restricted to motor neurons alone.  Ocular involvement is not a classic feature of ALS, however a growing body of evidence support retinal alterations. The retina, an expansion of the diencephalon, is part of the central nervous system that is commonly impacted in neurodegenerative diseases (3,15). Subtle retinal changes have been detected in Parkinson's disease, multisystem atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Alzheimer's disease (16,17). In multiple sclerosis (MS), it has been shown that ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer atrophy mirrors grey matter and whole brain atrophy, reflecting underlying disease progression (18). A multi-centered, cohort study by Martinez-Lapiscina et al. (2016) has also shown peripapillary RNFL thickness to be a useful biomarker of disability progression in MS (19). The selective changes of retinal layers may be a manifestation of the primary neurodegenerative processes (3). In a histopathological study of an ALS patient with C9orf72 mutation (most common pathologic mutation in familial ALS), Fawzi et al. (2014) reported p62-positive cytoplasmic inclusions in cone bipolar cells within the inner nuclear layer of the retina, with similar inclusions in the cerebellum and hippocampus (20).   The technology used to evaluate the retina in vivo is optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is a non-contact, non-invasive imaging technology that utilizes low coherence interferometry to form cross-sectional representations of the macula and optic nerve head. Using SD-OCT (Spectralis OCT; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), several studies have found thinning of several retinal layers, particularly the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in ALS (15,21-24). Regarding the clinical presentation and progression of ALS, studies have largely been limited to investigating correlations between OCT sublayer changes, and disease duration and ALSFRS (ALS functional rating scale) with inconsistent results (3, 15, 21, 23, 25). The literature in studying OCT as a biomarker of functional disability and ALS severity is otherwise limited. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge there is currently one paper conducted outside of North America, that has specifically investigated the correlation of MRI parameters regarding ALS with RNFL thickness as depicted by SD-OCT. Hübers et al. (2016) studied retinal changes in ALS patients using OCT, DTI and clinical characteristics, and demonstrated significant thinning of INL and RNFL (3). They further showed a positive correlation between thickness of retinal layers (including whole retina and RNFL) and FA of the corticospinal tract (3).   Advanced imaging modalities provide the opportunity to study disease pathology noninvasively, in vivo, over time. The objective of this two-part study is to evaluate the relationship between retinal thinning, clinical phenotype, and neuroimaging changes of ALS patients in a Canadian population. Using SD-OCT, average peripapillary RNFL thickness including 1/6th sector analysis to investigate regional susceptibility, sublayer and total macular thickness values will be obtained. For the first part of the study, these results will be evaluated in relation to clinical characteristics including ALS subtypes and specific measures of severity and disability (see below). For the second study, DTI of brain regions known to be affected in ALS will be acquired for comparison to OCT alterations. The need for a multimodality approach has emerged for improved disease characterization of ALS. Considering it as an inexpensive and more readily accessible alternative, the ability to use retinal layer thickness values, depicted by the SD-OCT, as a biomarker in ALS could potentially allow for earlier diagnosis and act as a monitoring tool in order to follow disease progression.

OND20190527SK,Sanjeev Kumar,Neuropsychiatric symptom burden across neurodegenerative disorders and its association with cognition and function,"Patients with neurodegenerative disorders Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) commonly experience neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS).  NPS include depression, apathy, agitation, delusions and hallucinations, and have been associated with accelerated disease progression, greater disability, and reduced quality of life. Better understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and their relartionship to cognition and function is crucial to management of these disorders. NPS have been linked to impairments in several cognitive domains including verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive function. However, the precise relationship between NPS, cognition and function across these disorders is not clear. ","To evaluate the association between NPS, cognition and function across AD, VCI, PD, FTD, and ALS cohorts.  H1: NPS symptoms burden as assessed by NPIQ will be different across AD, VCI, PD, FTD and ALS cohorts.  H2: Association of NPS, cognition and function will vary across disease cohorts.   H3: Longitudinal progression of NPS and their association with cognition and function will differ between disease cohorts but remain consistent within the cohorts.","NPIQ  ADCS  Neuropsych battery with subtests  Demographic variables    Participants enrolled in Ontario Neurodegenerative disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) Brain-Code database from AD, VCI, PD, FTD, and ALS cohorts will be included. We will first characterize baseline  demographics and neuropsychological variables for each cohort. Neuropsychiatric Inventory questionnaire (NPI-Q) will be used as a measure of NPS and will be compared across the cohorts. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and Physical Self maintenance scales will be used as measures of function. Then we will examine the longitudinal association of NPS, cognition and function in these cohorts. ","To assess baseline differences between patient cohorts on demographics Cognition and NPS analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal - Wallis test will be used as appropriate.  Then we will use cluster analyses to evaluate the utility of NPS in association with other variables to separate these cohorts at baseline and follow up points. Then separate linear regression analyses will be performed with NPS as predictor variable and cognition and function as dependent variable with age, gender, medical comorbidity and other covariates as appropriate. ",Improved understanding of NPS burden across neurodegenerative disorders and their association with cognition and function. This will result in improved diagnostic accuracy and better management of NPS across these disorders.
OND20190603CF,Corinne Fischer,Determining the Association of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms with Neurodegenerative Disease Biomarkers using the ONDRI platform,"Neurodegenerative diseases pose a great burden to patients, caregivers and health care providers. Unfortunately, there are limited methods to alleviate symptoms or halt the progression of the disease. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in this population. These include hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, aggressive behaviours, apathy and other psychotic symptoms that occur in many neurodegenerative conditions. In spite of the frequency of NPS, the underlying mechanisms and association with neurodegenerative/genetic biomarkers across disorders is unclear, thus limiting treatment options.  ","In this study, we will evaluate the association of NPS with neurodegenerative disease/genetic biomarkers across multiple disorders.  We predict that common associations between NPS domains and neurodegenerative/genetic biomarkers will occur across disorders.  ","APO-E 4, C9orf72 repeats, NeuroRx SNP, ONDRI seq, demographics, medications, adverse events, UPDRS, questionnaires, NPI, cognitive test battery.  ","Our project will include longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis of biomarker data, combined with clinical outcomes and its relation to NPS and associated domains. The study cohort consists of participants enrolled in Ontario Neurodegenerative disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) Brain-Code database, which includes patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI), Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). These cohorts will be categorized using baseline data of demographics, NPS measures from NPI-Q scores, cognitive test scores, neuropathology data (where available) and genetic data.   Analysis will include standard univariate null-hypothesis testing along with multivariate predictive modeling. Univariate testing will include baseline comparisons between NPS+ and NPS- groups. Longitudinal analysis will be conducted using linear mixed-effects models. Using multivariate data fusion techniques, such as canonical correlation analysis and partial least squares, both at baseline and longitudinally, associations between these cohorts will be extracted. Lastly, the ability of investigated biomarkers to predict NPS+ and NPS- groups and long-term functional outcome will be done using predictive generalization.   ",Identifying target biomarkers of NPS and predicting its relation to disease progression will be a crucial step in the research of neurodegenerative diseases. A more comprehensive understanding of the pathological features underlying NPS may provide important insights in diagnosis and treatment options as well.
OND20190604CF,Corinne Fischer,Determining the imaging correlates of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms across the ONDRI neurodegenerative disease platform,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are frequently seen in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer 's disease (AD), Vascular dementia, Frontal-temporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease related dementia (PD). NPS are a major risk factor for institutionalization, and are associated with numerous adverse outcomes.  Research to date suggests that NPS are associated with structural and functional brain changes which can be seen through various imaging techniques. ","The objective of this study is to investigate the association between NPS domains and neuroimaging data using the ONDRI data set. We will examine both baseline and longitudinal data and adjust our findings based on NPS severity, cognition and function. We hypothesize that the presence of NPS will be associated with increased rates of grey matter volume loss, increased white matter lesion burden and reduced functional connectivity across disorders.  ","Clinical data (demographics, vital signs, medical history, medication list, adverse events, UPDRS, questionnaires, MoCA score), Cognitive (cognitive test battery, NPI), Neuroimaging (structural T1 and T2 weighted scans, FLAIR, diffusion weighted scans, resting state fMRI)","This project will include longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis of neuroimaging and clinical data. The study cohort consists of participants enrolled in Ontario Neurodegenerative disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) Brain-Code database, which includes individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). These cohorts will be further subdivided according to demographics, NPS measures from NPI-Q scores, and cognitive test scores (MMSE and MoCA).   Analysis:   We will test for significant differences in functional connectivity, white matter lesion burden and grey matter volume, by performing voxelwise paired-measures analysis of baseline vs. follow-up values, for all patients, with bootstrap confidence bounds. In addition, we will perform voxelwise GLM analysis on the longitudinal changes, regressing longitudinal changes in functional connectivity and grey matter volume against measures of cognition, function and NPS total score and severity adjusting for confounders.  Due to the requirement of integrating large-scale neuroimaging and clinical data, we will draw from our established expertise in neuro-informatics. This includes a well-validated software infrastructure to be used for quality control, image processing, and analysis of large, multi-modal datasets.  ",Identifying the morphological brain changes preceding or associated with NPS may be useful in further characterizing associated brain mechanisms.  This information may lead to the development of more effective treatments for NPS.      
OND20190612AD,Allison A. Dilliott,Rare variations detected in the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative dataset,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to neurodegenerative disease risk (1-3). Due to each SNP's individually small effect to increase disease risk, common genetic variation identified through GWAS (4-6) cannot fully explain disease presentation. Importantly, GWAS are unable to identify rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or copy number variants (CNVs), which contribute larger effects and associations to disease risk and may account for some of this missing heritability.   Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an efficient sequencing approach that maximizes genetic information while minimizing costs. Unlike arrays that only target specific genomic coordinates, NGS sequences full genomic regions, allowing rare SNV identification (7, 8). Specifically, targeted sequencing with a custom designed panel focuses on selected exons, introns, or intergenic regions of interest. Therefore, this can be a cost-effective approach when a subset of genes are known, or predicted to be, associated with a particular disease, as is the case for neurodegeneration. ONDRISeq is a targeted NGS panel custom designed specifically for the purposes of ONDRI and covers 80 genes associated with the five neurodegenerative diseases under study (9). The panel will allow for the identification of rare SNVs, and CNVs in the genes of interest, thereby further elucidating the complex genetic landscape of neurodegenerative diseases.","In a series of publications, we aim to identify rare genetic variation in the genomic DNA of 519 ONDRI participants that is known or is likely to be contributing to disease and compare the burden of these variants to an age-matched neurologically normal control cohort. More specifically we have three aims:  1.	Identify rare, non-synonymous SNVs known, or predicted, to have a large phenotypic effect in 80 genes known to be associated with neurodegenerative disease encompassed on the ONDRISeq panel and encompassed by the NeuroX array.  2.	Identify large-scale CNVs in 80 genes known to be associated with neurodegenerative disease encompassed on the ONDRISeq panel and repeat expansions within the C9orf72 gene.  3.	Assess the burden of rare, non-synonymous variation in the participants' genomic DNA within each ONDRI cohort compared to a cognitively normal control cohort.   We hypothesize that ONDRI participants will harbour either rare SNVs of probable clinical significance or large-scale CNVs, or both. We expect to identify overlapping rare genetic factors contributing to the five phenotypes encompassed by ONDRI's mandate. Further, we hypothesize that ONDRI participants will have a significantly greater rare variant burden in the genes sequenced by ONDRISeq than that of the control cohort.  ","Genomics:  ONDRISeq sequencing data  NeuroX data  Clinical:   Demographic data (age, sex)  Family health history (possibly used if Mendelian variants are found)  Disease specific measures (AD versus MCI; FTD subtypes)    ","The variant annotation software, VarSeq® (Golden Helix, Bozeman, MT, United States), is used to annotate the SNVs identified in each participant including minor allele frequency (MAF) from human reference populations, in silico prediction scores of protein consequence, and previous disease association. VCF and BAM files will be imported into VarSeq® and participants' variants will be prioritized by selecting for SNVs non-synonymous in sequence ontology, with a MAF of ≤ 1%. SNVs are then further prioritized based on in silico prediction score to identify variants likely damaging to protein function and their absence from the Healthy Exomes database. These SNVs are hereafter referred to as rare SNVs of probable clinical significance.  VarSeq® will also be used to identify CNVs within the ONDRISeq data. Previously, detecting CNVs in NGS was tedious, with many algorithms calling false positives (10). VarSeq's CNV Caller tool uses normalized depth of coverage analysis to reliably identify large-scale duplications or deletions. Any CNV identified in an ONDRI participant will be confirmed with Sanger sequencing and/or the CytoScan™ HD Array (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States).  Rare variant association analysis (RVAAs) burden testing will be used to investigate whether an increased frequency of individuals possess rare SNVs of probable clinical significance detected by ONDRISeq in the disease cohorts compared to the controls. This will first be performed based on rare SNVs of probable clinical significance in any gene covered by the ONDRISeq panel harboured by the participants. Then the genes included on the ONDRISeq panel will be categorized based on their disease association. The genes associated with AD/MCI, ALS, FTD, and PD will be further categorized based on their degree of association with the disease including primary genes, such as those identified in OMIM to contribute to the respective disease presentation with a mendelian inheritance pattern, and secondary genes, for which more evidence may be needed to confirm genetic association with disease. RVAA burden analyses are then repeated for each cohort using these gene categories. Additionally, the optimal unified Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT-O) within the SKAT R package will allow for combinational RVAAs (11). SKAT-O will be used to identify genes sequenced by the ONDRISeq panel with a significantly greater burden of SNVs in affected individuals compared to controls. The analysis may also identify high SNV burden in genes that have been previously associated with a neurodegenerative disease that is distinct to that of the cohort being analyzed.  ","This analysis will provide a greater understanding of the genetic contribution of rare variants to the five neurodegenerative diseases under study. Further, by identifying genes, or groups of genes, with greater burdens of rare variants, particularly if there is greater burden across multiple disease phenotypes or in phenotypes not previously associated with the genes, we may identify genetic factors contributing to overlapping features of disease. This analysis will also allow us to bin participants based on their rare genetic variation and perform future multivariate analyses incorporating the data from other ONDRI platforms to identify features of disease that are genetically influenced. Ultimately, this work will contribute to acquiring a more complete view of the genetic landscape of neurodegeneration and may guide the development of clinically useful sequencing-based early diagnosis and progression prediction tools and possibly of novel therapeutic approaches.

OND20190626JP,Jessy Parokaran Varghese,Towards standardization of clinical quantitative posturography: the effect of stance width and vision on balance control in people with neurodegenerative disorders,"Measures of postural sway provide an integrated measure of the central nervous system (CNS) control of the body and may well serve as a potential biomarker of neurodegenerative disease and progression (Shumway-Cook & Woollacott, 2001). In spite of the potential importance, standards for clinical assessment of balance using quantitative posturography do not currently exist.                                            A critical matter in the development of assessment standards is the challenge of the balance task which can be easily influenced by the size of the base-of-support (e.g. stance width) and the availability of visual information. Previous studies have shown that stance width influences balance control in healthy adults and in other populations such as those with functional ankle disability, unilateral hip arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and spinocerebellar ataxia (Day et al., 1993; Ramdharry et al., 2009; Bunn et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2009, 2015). In these populations, postural instability has been shown to increase with decreasing stance width. In addition, there have been a few studies reporting increased postural instability in people with Parkinson's disease compared to healthy older adults when the base-of-support is reduced (Błaszczyk and Orawiec, 2011; Ickeinstein et al., 2012; Almeida et al., 2016). Conversely, no difference in postural stability was reported among Parkinsonian patients and healthy older adults during a two-legged stance with feet comfortably spaced apart (Termoz et al., 2008; Tsutiya et al., 2011).                                            Vision is an important source of sensory input that minimizes postural sway and may be easily manipulated during clinical assessments to discriminate standing balance ability. Clinical assessments have tested the ability of people to use visual information to identify deficits in balance control related to aging or caused by neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis (Chong et al., 1999). Balance impairments in clinical populations have been extensively evaluated through standing balance tasks involving eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Increased body sway of older adults has been observed in an eyes closed condition compared to young adults (Jamet et al., 2007; Day et al., 1993; Paulus et al., 1984). However, visual contribution to balance control seems to differ among people with neurodegenerative diseases (Gago et al., 2015; Chong et al., 1999). For instance, people with Alzheimer's disease did not increase their body sway when vision was absent in normal stance (Chong et al., 1999) but did increase ML sway while standing in feet together position compared to a control group (Gago et al., 2015). People with Parkinson's disease presented higher variations in center of pressure under an eyes closed condition indicating visual dependence (Lahr et al., 2015) but when visual information was available, they did not reduce their postural instability as expected (Paulocci et al., 2018).                                                  The inconsistency of these findings could be related to the use of different measures to quantify or characterize balance. In order to standardize clinical posturography, it is necessary to determine whether stance width and visual condition (eyes open and eyes closed) can be used to describe and discriminate static balance impairments in clinical populations.  ","The aim of the study is to examine the effect of stance width and vision in static balance control in people with neurodegenerative diseases to determine if increased challenge, either in stance width and/or availability of visual input reveals increased dyscontrol (increased relative sway). A related objective is to investigate whether there exists any correlation between balance conditions. In other words, does a simple task predict the more challenging task which would have an impact on the selection of a standardized task protocol?","Demographic data, clinical measures, and parameters extracted from balance data of all ONDRI participants.","Summary statistics, ANOVA (to compare each balance measure of patients in different cohorts and across task conditions within cohorts), correlation analysis and multivariate regression (to examine balance measures between narrow and standard stances).","Given the distributed CNS control of balance, there is the potential that balance control may serve as a sensitive biomarker of neurodegenerative disease.  Currently, the lack of standardization of balance testing and control of task challenge is a barrier to understanding the potential link to disease. The results of this study will guide recommendations regarding the standardization of quantitative clinical balance testing to assess CNS status associated with neurodegenerative disease."
OND20190626PFP,Paula Favaro Polastri,The relationship between neurodegenerative disease severity and balance control,"There are several clinical, biochemical, neuroimaging, and genetic biomarkers developed for neurodegenerative diseases. However, their specificity and sensitivity are different when applied individually. Measures of postural sway have been used to infer about the progression and severity of neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, complexity of postural sway fluctuations as measured by 'complexity index' has been suggested to be a clinical marker of functional decline and a tool for monitoring the disease onset progression in patients with Fragile X Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (O'Keeffe et al., 2018). Similarly, postural centre of pressure (COP) sway parameters, specifically medio-lateral (ML) sway measures, were able to detect disease progression better than UPDRS scores in untreated Parkinsonian patients (Mancini et al., 2012). Objective measures of postural sway such as ML sway jerkiness, sway dispersion (root mean square (RMS) relative to the mean), sway velocity, and sway frequency increased over a one year period suggesting progressive deterioration in balance control whereas minimal changes were observed in UPDRS motor scores in these patients (Mancini et al., 2012). In addition, velocity, total distance, amplitude and frequency of COP sway have been related to disease severity in individuals with Parkinson's disease (Godinho et al., 2016). Research in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases has also revealed the potential use of COP sway measures to detect the onset of disease or therapeutic effectiveness (Hutchinson et al., 2007). These results support the potential for postural sway measures to be used as a biomarker of disease severity but little research has been conducted to explore these relationships across neurodegenerative disorders.","This study aims to determine the potential utility of using measures of static balance control as a marker of health of the central nervous system, especially whether balance control measures could serve as a potential biomarker of neurodegenerative disease severity. This study also aims to perform a comparative analysis of static balance control measures among people with various neurodegenerative diseases and whether there exists any correlation between balance measures and disease severity.","Demographic Data (age, sex, weight, height, body mass index, diagnosis, cognitive status, education), clinical information (MoCA, MDS-UPDRS, Modified Rankin Scale, Disease specific measures, Participant healthy history, concomitant medications, Mobility scales) and center of pressure (COP) parameters (root mean square COP sway in medial-lateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions, path length (ML and AP), average COP velocity (ML and AP), mean frequency (ML and AP), Radial average, and Area 95) extracted from balance data for all ONDRI participants.","Summary statistics, ANOVA (to compare each balance measure of patients in different cohorts and across task conditions within cohorts), correlation analysis and multivariate regression (to examine balance measures between narrow and standard stances and associate relationship with disease severity, motor impairment, and age).",Identifying accurate biomarkers for early detection of neurodegenerative diseases and their progression will help to develop new clinical interventions and treatments that could prevent or slow disease progression and provide the best care for people living with neurodegenerative disease.
OND20190712DB,Derek Beaton,Relationship between caregiving burdens and clinical characteristics in the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI),"Persons living with neurodegenerative disorders or dementia are often cared for by informal caregivers (e.g., family, friends) Informal caregivers experience various types of stress and strain and few studies have parsed the multidimensional aspects of caregiving burdens across multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Doing so is important for informing both general and disease-specific caregiver education and training programs, as well as the overall health and well-being of patients and Caregivers. Within the ONDRI study, we examined data from the Zarit Burden Inventory from study partners of participants across five neurodegenerative disorders.   ","(1) Identify factors of caregiving burdens and the relationships with cognition and demographics, (2) Identify the co-factors of caregiving burdens and neuropsychiatric symptoms and activities of daily living.","NPSY: Cognitive (minimum; domains), neuropsychiatric inventory, instrumental/activities of daily living  CLIN: DEMOG, MOCA, DHX, Zarit's  ","(1) (a) Correspondence analysis (akin to PCA for categorical or ordinal data) on the Zarit's to identify the factors of caregiving burden, and (b) correlations between/group analyses of the identified factors of caregiving burdens and cognition (as measured by the NPSY cognitive domains) and generally demographics (e.g., age, sex, partner type, cohort); and (2) a partial least squares-correspondence analysis between the Zarit's and the neuropyschiatric inventory + instrumental/activities of daily living.","By 2020 we expect a two-fold increase in the number of  persons living with neurodegenerative disorders or dementia, which places an eight-fold increase in health-care and caregiving related costs. By identifying these types of and contributions to caregiver burden, we can better inform resource allocation and health policy initiatives. ONDRI is well positioned to help identify types of caregiving burdens across a variety of neurodegenerative disorders through longitudinal analyses and in conjunction with a variety of biological, neural, cognitive, and behavioral measures.

OND20190724MM,Manuel Montero-Odasso,"Apoe-4, Gait  Impairments, and WMH  across Neurodegenerative Disorders From ONDRI","The Apolipoprotein allele 4 (Apoe-4) can affect lipids metabolism consequently causing White Matter lesions also identified as White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) in the brain. Higher WMH burden and the Apoe-4 genotype are both indicators of low cognitive performance, higher risk of Alzheimer's Disease dementia and more recently both risk factors were associated with gait impairments among older adults without neurodegenerative disorders. Gait impairments are highly prevalent in neurodegenerative disorders, and they have been used as a predictor of adverse outcomes. We previously demonstrated in older adults with MCI that those who have 2 alleles of the Apoe-4  gene presented impairment in gait performance (JGMS). However, it is still unknown to what extent the Apoe-4 genotype contributes to gait impairments, including slow gait, across neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, it is unknown whether the relationship between Apoe-4 status and gait performance is mediated by WMH burden in these individuals.  ","Presence of Apoe-4 genotype will be more prevalent in slow walkers than non-slow walkers in all neurodegenerative disease cohorts from ONDRI. This association will be mediated by higher WMH burden, which is evident in individuals with significant cognitive impairment compared with those without significant cognitive impairment due to the well-known association between gait and cognition.　 ","Cross-sectional study using ONDRI variables. Main outcome measures will be Apoe-4 testing, gait speed under single and dual-task conditions, global cognition, and WMH.  Demographics and clinical data including genotypes, disease severity scales, NIH stroke scale, MoCA, medications and number of comorbidities. Neuropsychological data including executive function and memory tests will be used to determine sub-types of cognitive decline of individuals (e.g. amnestic or non-amnestic subtypes). All collected from AD/MCI, ALS, FTD, PD and VCI cohorts in ONDRI. ","Mediation analysis using linear regression models applied to each ONDRI cohort. WMH will be entered as the mediator factor of associations between Apoe-4 status and gait performance. In this case, sub-group analysis stratified by individuals with and without significant cognitive impairments will also be performed. Models will be adjusted by age, sex, years of education, global cognition and number of comorbidities. ","This study is an attempt to provide empirical evidence that impaired gait performance in neurodegenerative disorders is a behavioral expression of an individual's genotype, irrespective of neurodegenerative disorders. Further, the findings of this study can facilitate the understanding of underlying neural mechanism of the relationship between Apoe-4 and slow gait in individuals at risk of dementia. Results from this study have important practical clinical implications since gait assessment is inexpensive and quickly done in virtually any clinical set up. "
OND20190808CM,Connie Marras,Genetics determinants of cognitive profile in PD,"ognitive deficits in PD are highly variable in severity and progression.  Mild cognitive impairment in PD is highly prevalent and also variable in profile. PD-MCI has been classified according to the cognitive domains affected, and has also been subtyped based on data-driven approaches.    The cause(s) of cognitive variability in PD are unknown, but genetic determinants have been proposed and genetic associations with PD-dementia have been demonstrated.   The CIHR-funded TWH PD-MCI project, led by Connie Marras, Mario Masellis and Sarah Duff-Canning, is a prospective longitudinal cohort study enrolling non-demented PD patients and assessing their cognitive profile in detail.  Blood has been taken for the evaluation of genetic variants associated with cognition.  The neuropsychological test battery is highly analogous to the ONDRI battery.  The TWH PD-MCI data has been used to explore the heterogeneity of PD-MCI using a data-driven approach and four clusters were identified, described as 'visuospatial,' 'executive', 'executive+visuospatial' and 'global' according to the domains most impaired.   In our funded CIHR grant application we developed specific hypotheses concerning the relationships between these clusters and genetic variants (see Hypotheses, below).  These hypotheses have not been tested; data collection in the TWH PD-MCI project is ongoing, and due to finish later in 2018.

OND20190812MM,Manuel Montero-Odasso,Association between Cognitive Domains and Balance Performance across Neurodegenerative Disorders: Results from the ONDRI ,"Deficits in balance and cognition are highly prevalent in older adults with neurodegenerative disorders (ND), and increase falls risk among these patients. Previous studies suggest that postural control consumes cognitive resources in older adults particularly in ND such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and dementia prodromal including individuals with stroke and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In these previous studies, the evaluation of cognitive control over balance was often performed during situations where individuals attempted to keep optimum stability while attending to stimuli that require processing in one or more than one cognitive domains (i.e. dual-tasks). These concurrent cognitive tasks place higher attention, executive function and working memory demands; However, the role of specific cognitive domains, particularly beyond the attention/executive construct, has not been previously assessed across ND.  We propose that using neuropsychological indexes would be a robust strategy to better understand the importance of different cognitive resources for motor disability in NDs given its standardization and validation. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to examine associations between specific cognitive domains assessed with standardized neuropsychological assessments for attention, executive function, working memory, visuospatial, and language domains with postural sway across different ND. Based on previous findings on the interaction between cognition and balance impairments, we hypothesize that poor performance in specific cognitive domains would be differentially associated with the increased postural sway across ND. Our sample will include participants with Frontal Temporal Dementia (FTD), Alzheimer Dementia (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); and dementia prodromal including Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Vascular Cognitive impairment (VCI).  ",The main aim of this study is to examine associations between construct of cognitive domains and postural sway during different postural and visual feedback conditions.     We hypothesize that common cognitive domains across NDs and NDs prodromal will be associated with balance performance. And this association will show that worse cognitive performance will be associated with larger postural sway particularly during more challenging conditions. ,"Cognitive variables for cognitive domain calculation: SDMT, TMT-A, DST, Stroop-color (measures of attention/working memory); TMT-B, VFT, Stroop-inhibition/switch (measures of executive function); RAVT, BVMT (measures of memory); JLO, VOSP (measures of visuospatial perception); BNT, TAWF, Vocab (measures of language). Center of pressure (COP) amplitude during conditions of wide and narrow-base of support with eyes open and closed will used as dependent variables. ","Univariate linear regression models will be created to test the association between cognitive domains (independent variable) and postural sway (dependent variable) adjusted for covariates (e.g. age, sex, body mass index, education, leg length, calf circumference, assistive device, depression, medications). ",Determining the common cognitive problems associated with balance impairments across ND using standardized neuropsychological tests may accelerate balance intervention outcomes. This knowledge could also be important when designing dual-task protocols aiming assessments and intervention for ND. 
OND20190820JH,Jeff Huang,Altered pupil dynamics in the progression of Parkinson's disease,"In Parkinson's disease (PD), the progressive loss of brain matter from neurodegeneration leads to impairments in autonomic, motor, and cognitive functions. Pupillometry has been increasingly used in clinical investigations to assess cognitive function as the pupil is not only affected by global luminance and arousal, but also modulated by converging bottom-up sensory and top-down cognitive signals. Previous studies have found pupil responses to be modulated by the preparation of voluntary eye movements likely related to the fronto-oculomotor network, and this modulation is disrupted in PD patients with executive function deficits. Subjects performed the interleaved pro-/anti-saccade task as part of the eye tracking platform, in which they were instructed via the colour of a fixation cue to generate either an automatic eye movement toward a peripheral stimulus (pro-saccade) or a voluntary eye movement in the opposite direction (anti-saccade).","Aim: To investigate progression of changes in cognitive-related pupil responses in PD patients  Hypothesis: Modulation of pupil dynamics by saccade preparation is altered by neurodegeneration related to frontal-oculomotor regions, and is affected by disease progression.   ","Longitudinal data of the following variables will be examined:  Variables from the eye tracking, clinical, and neuropsychology platform will be used in our analysis. Measures from the eye tracking platform includes saccade-related measures like Saccadic reaction time and Error rate, as well as pupil-related measures including Baseline pupil size, Pupil response onset latency, Pupil constriction size, Peak constriction time, Pupil constriction velocity, Pupil dilation size, and Pupil dilation velocity. Measures from the clinical platforms includes age, sex, MoCA scores, and disease specific variables such as medication and tests including the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, and MDS-UPDRS. Measures from the neuropsychology platform includes specific measures that relates to visuospatial skills, attention, and executive cognition.  ",Descriptive statistics and graphical summaries for all variables of interest. pupil and saccade variables will be analyzed for their modulation by task condition. Correlation analysis will be performed between pupil dynamic measures with saccadic performance as well as with clinical scores.,The non-invasive measures of pupil dynamics can serve as biomarkers for autonomic and cognitive deficit in frontal-oculomotor regions in PD disease progression
OND20190822KF,Keera Fishman,Bilingualism in Parkinson's disease: Help or hindrance on cognition and quality of life?,"Bilingualism has been shown to promote cognitive reserve. We aimed to determine whether bilingualism compensates for difficulties in executive function (EF) in Parkinson's disease (PD), or whether PD prevents the proposed benefits of bilingualism from emerging, possibly affecting quality of life (QoL) and independence.     Only one previous study has examined the role of bilingualism on cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is characterized by motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability) and a broad spectrum of non-motor features, including sleep, sensory, cognitive, and affective disturbances (Muslimović, Post, Speelman, De Haan, & Schumand, 2009; Poewe, 2006). Cognitive dysfunction in PD ranges from 36% at the time of diagnosis to 93% in more advanced disease stages (Foltynie, Brayne, Robbins, & Barker, 2004). Cognitive impairment in PD, including MCI, is characterized primarily by deficits in EF, although there are also documented changes in attention, language, memory, visuospatial abilities, and working memory (Farina et al., 2000; Stefanova, Kostic, Ziropadja, Ocic, & Markovic, 2001; Uc, Rizzo, Anderson, Qian, Rodnitzky, & Dawson, 2005). In a sample of individuals with relatively early PD (over 60% with Hoehn and Yahr [H&Y] of 1), Hindle and colleagues (2015) found that bilinguals (n = 46) performed worse than monolinguals (n = 57) on language tasks, and there were no group differences on EF tasks such as verbal fluency, attention switching, response inhibition, and visual abstraction. Taken together, these results suggest that when the EF system is compromised (as is common in ADHD and in PD), bilingualism does not provide any benefit - and may even be a detriment - to cognition. However, it is unknown whether bilingualism offers any positive, negative, or neutral consequences on cognition, report of cognitive decline, quality of life, or functional independence, in later stages of PD.  Regardless of language status, there is also evidence showing that impaired EF in PD is adversely related to self-reported quality of life (QoL) and functional abilities (Kudlicka, Claire, & Hindle, 2013, 2014). Specifically, impairments in executive skills are associated with poorer QoL and less independence in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADLs; Hirayama, Gobbi, Gobbi, & Stella, 2008; Kudlicka et al., 2014). Thus, if bilingualism impacts EF in individuals with PD, it may also influence the QoL and functional abilities in this population.","In the current study, we expanded on Hindle and colleagues (2015) findings by exploring a broader range of cognitive domains, self- and informant-report of cognition, general well-being, and functional abilities. We focused on slightly more advanced stages of PD and examined bilingualism as both a categorical and continuous variable. Our study explores whether bilingualism confers an advantage or disadvantage to cognition, function, and quality of life in individuals with mild to moderate PD. Specifically, the goals of the study are (a) to evaluate the impact of bilingualism on a wide range of cognitive domains in PD, (b) to determine whether bilingualism impacts self- and informant-reported cognitive decline, quality of life, and functional abilities in PD, and (c) if bilingualism is related to functional abilities and quality of life, to explore whether EF mediates these relationships. ","Clinical Platform: Disease specific history (including subtyping), demographics, questionnaires, and MoCA scores.   Neuropsychology Platform: Minimum dataset.  ","Chi-square and t-tests were conducted to compare monolinguals and bilinguals on demographic and disease variables.   MANOVAs and ANOVAs were used to explore group differences between monolinguals and bilinguals in neuropsychological domains, self- and informant-reported cognitive decline, QoL, and functional ability. Significant multivariate group differences in neuropsychological domains were followed by univariate analyses of the individual tests using raw scores and controlling for age, sex, and years of education.   Pearson correlations were used to determine how the degree of bilingualism was related to neuropsychological domains, self- and informant-reported cognitive decline, QoL, and functional ability, for individuals reporting knowledge of a second language (n = 83).","The following study will expand on our understanding of the role of bilingualism on executive functioning, language, and memory, in PD - a population whereby the EF system is commonly compromised. It will also help to elucidate any impact of bilingualism on quality of life and functional abilities independent of cognitive status."
OND20190830BW,Bryan M. Wong,Macular and Peripapillary Retinal Nerve Fibre Layer Thickness in Frontotemporal Dementia,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous group of clinical syndromes characterized by prominent changes in personality, language, and motor function. Clinically, there are six variants of FTD: behavioural variant (bvFTD), non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), semantic variant PPA (svPPA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and FTD with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). It is the second-most common form of dementia in people under 65 years old, only behind Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Hodges et al 2003, Knopman and Roberts, 2011). Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the pathological substrate that causes FTD and is associated with two predominant proteinopathies, FTD-Tau (featuring abnormal Tau protein aggregates) and FTD-TDP (featuring the 43 kDa transactive response (TAR) DNA binding protein (TDP43)). The various different neuropathological mechanisms that can cause FTD make it difficult not only to distinguish it from other neurodegenerative diseases, but also between its subtypes. For instance, up to 30% of clinically diagnosed FTD patients receive a primary neuropathologic diagnosis of AD (Kertesz 2005, Knibb 2006, Irwin et al 2013). Currently, there are limitations to reliably diagnose specific FTD neuropathologies prior to autopsy (Irwin et al 2015). FTD can be classified either based on pathological or clinical features. Pathologically, some of these subtypes are solely associated with abnormal Tau (ie. PSP), some with TDP43 (ie. svPPA and FTD-MND), while others cannot be determined in vivo as they are associated with both (Olney et al 2017). Interestingly, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is another neurodegenerative disease that contains abnormal TDP43 aggregates (Masala et al 2018).    Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is a standard of care for imaging the layers of the retina. The inner retinal layers contain ganglion cells and their axons, which transmit neural signals to the brain via the optic nerve. Changes in retinal thickness have been reported in neurodegenerative diseases, potentially as a result of ganglion cell death secondary to retrograde degeneration of cortical neurons (Kirbas et al 2013, Cunha et al 2017). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that retinal thickness may be used as potential biomarkers for FTD. Moreover, Tau protein has been found in the ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina in elderly patients (Ho et al 2012).    At the time of this study, there is no consensus in the literature whether retinal thickness in the macula or peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) is affected in FTD. Stemplewitz et al (2017) found decreased macular and pRFNL thickness in the PSP subtype of FTD patients compared to healthy controls. Kim (2017) found outer macular thinning in FTD compared to controls and that the outer macular thickness correlated with MMSE. In a follow up study (Kim 2019), those with FTD tauopathies were found to have progressive outer macular thinning compared to controls, and the amount of thinning correlated with the decline in MMSE score. Other groups have found thinning of the pRNFL in FTD compared to healthy controls, mild AD (Ferrari et al 2017), and Parkinson's disease (PD) (Sevim et al 2018).    Because of the heterogeneous neuropathology of FTD, it is important to differentiate between the two main classes of pathology. We propose to investigate the thickness of the macula and pRNFL in two different FTD pathological subtypes: FTD tauopathy (consisting of the PSP clinical variant) and FTD-TDP43 (consisting of the svPPA variant, and including subjects with ALS). Additionally, correlations between any potential retinal changes and FTD disease severity will be investigated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. ","1. Compare retinal thickness in the central macular sector between FTD tauopathy and TDP43 subgroups (Primary outcome)    2. Compare retinal thickness in the superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal macular sectors between FTD tauopathy and TDP43 subgroups    3. Compare peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) thickness in 6 sectors around the optic nerve head and globally between FTD tauopathy and TDP43 subgroups    4. Assess whether any changes in retinal thickness in the central macular sector correlate with FTD disease severity, as measured by UPDRS score    5.

For study aims #4-6, a mixed model approach proposed by Hamlett, Ryan, and Wolfinger (2004) will be used to estimate the correlation coefficient between the various retinal thicknesses and UPDRS.","With limitations in the definitive diagnoses of FTD from other neurodegenerative diseases as well its own subtypes, OCT findings can potentially serve as a biomarker to provide a rapid, non-invasive, and cost-efficient method to improve diagnostic specificity of this heterogeneous group of diseases."
OND20190917KW,Kyle Weber,The impact of cut-point and epoch length selection in quantifying activity intensity using accelerometers,"There is a clear link between physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, and health outcomes. Wearable technologies, such as accelerometers, allow PA to be measured objectively and continuously for multiple days, reducing the need for biased self-report methods and improving our ability to capture, classify, and quantify individuals' activity. At present, objectively measured PA is most often categorized using windowed (epoched) accelerometer data and a threshold system to determine the average absolute intensity of activity (e.g. light, moderate, vigorous) in that window. The thresholds applied to the data are dependent on the population, accelerometer wear location, and methods used to establish them. Unfortunately, these conditions are often unaccounted for when measuring PA, compromising the validity of the approach. Additionally, measured PA is influenced by epoch length and there is currently no consensus on the length of time over which accelerometer data should be averaged, further compromising our ability to meaningfully interpret activity outcomes derived from accelerometry. ",This study aims to demonstrate the impact of different thresholds and epoch lengths on the measurement of activity intensity and volume in order to illustrate the importance of establishing appropriate methods for characterizing PA from accelerometry. It is hypothesized that using threshold sets published by different authors will lead to significant differences in activity profiles. It is also hypothesized that measured PA will decrease while sedentary time will increase as epoch length increases. ,"•	Datasets: non-tabular, accelerometer data files from the ONDRI@Home pilot project (OND05, OND07)  •	Threshold sets: accelerometer threshold sets published by Powell et al.

Such considerations will be particularly important for application to specific populations, including those represented within the ONDRI cohorts."
OND20190924FT,Faryan Tayarri,Retinal thickness parameters in patients with cognitive impairment and past history of stroke,"Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a neurodegenerative disease, which develops from structural damage to the brain following disruption of blood perfusion. The most common cause of VCI is stroke, which leads to damage and death of neurons and their axons, and consequently loss of brain function. It is hypothesized that the retina may be susceptible to the same damage that results in neurodegenerative disease in the brain. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment  (MOCa) is a standard test used to identify those with cognitive decline. Although it was originally designed to identify Alzheimer 's disease it is now used as a global screening test for other neurodegenerative diseases.  Other specific neuropsychological testing aimed at identifying deficits in executive function and processing speed 1-3 is thought to more sensitive at identifying those with cognitive deficits in VCI.      Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can evaluate the thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) as well as ganglion cell analysis (GCA) of the macula complex. In the strokes that have involved post chiasmal visual pathway, there will be corresponding homonymous loss on GCA testing. This is due to retrograde degeneration in cases of strokes affecting optic tract and trans-synaptic degeneration in if stroke affected visual radiations6,7. One study has also previously reported an association between increased pRNFL thickness with lower processing speed and cognitive ability in healthy older individuals 4.

OND20190930BC,Ben Cornish,Characteristics of gait speed estimations using bilateral ankle-worn accelerometers in Neurodegenerative disease populations,"Instability during standing or walking is associated with increased risk of falling in neurodegenerative disease populations (NDD). Mobility decline has been evaluated during clinical tasks, such as straight ahead walking, using measures of gait velocity, dual task cost, and step/stride variability (Montero-Odasso, Muir, & Speechley, 2012). Performance during these tasks is influenced by disease severity (McGough, Logsdon, Kelly, & Teri, 2013). Gait and dual task cost are used to investigate a cognitive and physical function relationship, which if of special interest in neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, pressure sensor mats and stopwatches evaluate gait speed in these clinical environments. These methods are useful to provide summary metrics describing the movement pattern at a basic level; however, are limited to provide advanced analytics regarding quality of movement and control. Wearable sensors such as ankle-worn accelerometers are beneficial for clinical and research purposes because of their portable, inexpensive, and minimally intrusive nature. Using wearable sensors to examine pathological gait can provide more comprehensive information regarding different phases of clinical gait tasks which may be more vulnerable to change, such as: acceleration/deceleration phases, moment-to-moment changes to steady state patterns (Lindemann et al., 2008), frequency analysis (Brodie et al., 2014), and acceleration magnitude, smoothness and local stability (IJmker & Lamoth, 2012).     Currently, pressure sensor mats are the gold standard for clinical gait analysis, however in most clinical environments, these tools are unattainable. The utility of wearable sensors provides the ability estimate gait speed measures and are available at a fraction of cost. Gait velocities between accelerometers and pressure sensor mats have been compared (Lord, Rochester, Baker, & Nieuwboer, 2008), however no validation has occurred for individuals with NDD under both normal, fast, and dual task gait which may have altered walking patterns. The main objective of this study is to determine the association of accelerometer gait speed estimations to gold standard measures from pressure sensor mats within a cohort of individuals with NDD.     Another benefit to wearable sensors during clinical walking tasks is the potential of a comprehensive movement analysis. The secondary objective of this study is to characterize gait variability in NDD populations by examining gait speed changes during a clinical walking task and utilizing advanced analytics to further characterize movement quality differences between neurodegenerative disease cohorts.  ","The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of low-cost, wearable sensor technology to assess gait. This study aims to help improve the clinical assessment of gait by evaluating gait speed, using body-worn accelerometers, and movement control, using dynamic acceleration measures. The specific objective of this study is to reveal the ability to assess gait velocity using ankle-worn accelerometers compared to pressure sensitive mats within a cohort of individuals with NDD and investigate the ability to characterize moment-to-moment changes to an individual's steady state walking ability.     [H1]: It is hypothesized that gait velocity, temporal characteristics, step to step variability, and moment to moment changes to gait velocity estimations measured with ankle worn accelerometers will be highly correlated to pressure sensor mat velocity outcome measures.    ","Gait speed, dual task cost, capacity index ",Correlation analysis will determine the relationship between measurement devices (comparing analysis methods) and outcome measures (differences across cohorts). Error between devices will help demonstrate scenarios where differences of task or cohort might exist.     ,"Individuals with NDD have an increased risk of falling and compromised mobility which can in turn lead to less participation in daily life activities and negatively influence health related outcomes. Gait characteristics are an important measure into the control of dynamic stability and mobility control and can provide insight to the cognitive-physical function relationship and fall risk for patients with NDD. Primarily, this study will validate the ability to assess gait speed using accelerometers compared to pressure sensor mats with an NDD population. Secondly, this project will increase our understanding of the utility of low-cost wearable sensors to describe the quality of movement and control in an NDD sample population. Improving the assessment of gait speed in a clinical scenario has the potential to better assess fall risk and movement control issues for clinical populations. "
OND20200312PGL,Paulina Gonzalez-Latapi,Association of COMT polymorphism with cognitive status and motor complications in idiopathic Parkinson disease patients. ,"Parkinson Disease (PD) remains one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. PD is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta; this leads to the development of motor symptoms including tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. Currently, treatment for PD is focused on symptom control and improvement in quality of life. Dopaminergic medications remain the cornerstone of PD treatment, and Levodopa/Carbidopa is still the most effective drug available for symptomatic management of PD. After a variable period of time on dopaminergic treatment, PD patients can develop motor complications including motor fluctuations (MF) and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. MF include delayed on, 'on-off phenomenon', dose failure and wearing-off. Cumulative incidence of MF has been reported between 20% and 54%, and some patients develop MF within months, while others don't experience these symptoms until more than 10 years after disease onset. The pathophysiology of motor fluctuations includes loss of presynaptic dopaminergic terminals, increased dopamine turnover as well as post-synaptic changes in genes and proteins that mediate receptor and intracellular activity.     Motor fluctuations are more common in female patients, those with younger age at onset, higher score in the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III and higher levodopa daily dose. The association between MF and cognitive changes has also been studied. The Cambridge Parkinson's Incidence from GP to Neurologist (CamPaIGN) cohort reported no association between MF and dementia after 13-year follow up. Larsen et al conducted a community-based prevalence study; patients without MF had a lower mean Mini-Mental State Examination score and were twice as likely to have dementia compared to patients with MF (31.6% vs. 15.1%).  The same tendency was reported in a cross-sectional and longitudinal study by Modreanu et al, where patients with Parkinson disease dementia had a trend for absent to mild MF.     Cognitive dysfunction and dementia are common among PD patients. These symptoms become more prominent as PD progresses, although mild cognitive deficits can be detected in 15% to 25% of newly diagnosed patients. Cognitive changes in PD are characterized by executive dysfunction, which includes impairments in set-shifting, working memory, problem-solving and planning. Several pathways are involved in the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD; dopamine seems to play a role in modulating executive functions, with an inverted-U shaped relationship between dopamine levels and prefrontal function.     Gene variants in enzymes involved in dopamine metabolism, particularly catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), seem to play a role in modulating this relationship. COMT gene polymorphisms have been of interest given their possible influence on regulation of dopamine levels in cortical areas. In particular, the peptide bond sequence of the COMT gene may change at the position of codon 158, resulting in substitution of valine (Val) into methionine (Met). Val homozygotes (Val/Val) code for COMT with 40% higher enzymatic activity in dopamine metabolism, resulting in a reduction in brain dopamine. As such, the Val158Met polymorphism seems to play an important role in dopamine turnover in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. It may be that in PD, this also becomes the main pathway mediating dopamine turnover. Two studies on cognitive control showed that patients with early-stage PD who were Met homozygotes had poorer performances in set-like behavior. This is thought to be due to a compensatory hyperdopaminergic state within the frontal cortex in Met homozygotes in early stage PD. It is postulated that performance of PD Met homozygotes may improve as the disease progresses and prefrontal dopamine level decreases, although studies have had inconsistent results. Dopamine turnover is one of the mechanisms that seem to influence the development of motor fluctuations. In one study in Chinese population, Met/Met homozygosity was associated with a decreased risk of developing wearing-off; no data on cognitive function was reported in this study.     The association between COMT polymorphisms and MF have not been completely elucidated, in addition the association between these polymorphisms and cognitive performance in PD patients with motor fluctuations, compared to non-fluctuators, has not been described.    The Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) is a multi-platform, province-wide, observational prospective cohort study aiming to characterize five neurodegenerative disease groups, one of which is Parkinson's Disease. ONDRI incorporates genomic and a comprehensive phenotypic assessment of each participant. This large data set and consistent enrollment criteria allows for the opportunity to characterize PD patients with motor fluctuations and without motor fluctuations; analysis of COMT gene polymorphisms may aid to elucidate the association between motor fluctuations and cognitive changes in PD patients.","Aim 1  Describe the clinical and demographic differences between Parkinson disease patients with motor fluctuations and without motor fluctuations (stable responders) matched by age and disease duration.     	Hypotheses:  1)	Patients with motor fluctuations will have higher MDS-UPDRS Part III total score (signifying increased disease severity), higher LEDD and higher Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (signifying better cognition).  2)	A larger proportion of patients with motor fluctuations will be Val homozygotes (Val/Val) compared to patients without motor fluctuations.     Aim 2  Describe the association and pattern of cognitive abnormalities (MCI or PDD) and COMT Val158Met polymorphism in patients with motor fluctuations and in patients without motor fluctuations (stable responders).    Hypotheses:  a)	A larger proportion of patients with motor fluctuations and with MCI or PDD will be Met homozygotes.    b)	The pattern of cognitive abnormalities in Met homozygotes will affect predominantly executive function tasks.    Aim 3  Compare longitudinal changes in cognition in patients with Parkinson Disease and motor fluctuations and without motor fluctuations (stable responders) and COMT Val158Met polymorphisms.     Hypotheses  a)	We hypothesize that PD patients with motor fluctuations will have higher (better) scores in cognitive performance tests at baseline compared to PD patients without motor fluctuations. Because of this, we hypothesize that, on follow up, changes in cognitive performance in PD with motor fluctuations will appear to be of greater magnitude, compared to changes in cognitive performance in PD without motor fluctuations.  b)	Given the 'inverted U' relationship between dopamine levels and prefrontal function, as PD progresses, we hypothesize that Val/Val homozygotes will present worsening of their cognitive performance compared with their baseline cognitive performance. For this same reason, we hypothesize that with PD progression, Met/Met homozygotes will have stable to slightly improved cognitive performance. ","Participant demographics (including age, gender, body weight, education level)  MoCA  Disease Specific History (disease duration, levodopa treatment duration, LEDD)  MDS-UPDRS (Total and individual component scores)  Physical Assessment  Concomitant Medications (COMT-I, MAOB-I, DA)  NeuroX SNP data (specifically Val158Met polymorphism in COMT)  Cognitive assessment  ","For Aim 1 and 2: Descriptive statistics comparing motor fluctuators and stable responders with t-test, Fisher's exact test and Pearson Chi-square test as appropriate. Statistical significance will be defined as p <0.05. Motor fluctuators and stable responders will be divided into three groups (Val homozygotes, Val/Met heterozygotes and Met homozygotes). Groups will be compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test for non-parametric variables.   For Aim 3: One-way ANOVA will be used to compare stable responders and motor fluctuators and Val homozygotes, Val/Met heterozygotes and Met homozygotes. Cox proportional hazards ratio will be used to analyze conversion to MCI or PDD. ","This study will expand on our knowledge about motor fluctuations and cognitive abnormalities in Parkinson Disease. By comparing disease duration and age-matched Parkinson disease patients with motor fluctuations and without motor fluctuations we will gain a better understanding of the demographic and clinical factors that may be associated with an earlier development of motor fluctuations. Additionally, it will be one of the first studies to specifically analyze the association of motor fluctuations and cognitive abnormalities in Parkinson Disease. Finally, in analyzing the presence of COMT gene variants, we will gain a better understanding of dopamine metabolism and its role in the development of motor fluctuations and cognitive changes in Parkinson Disease. Overall this study aligns very well with the overarching mission of ONDRI, particularly, the findings from this study have the potential to improve the way we approach treatment for our patients which will ultimately improve their care.

OND20200407RM,Rubina Malik,Identifying neurocognitive mechanisms and generic variants associated with the development apathy in neurodegenerative dementias ,"Apathy is the most common neuropsychiatric symptom in frontotemporal dementias (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD; Nobis & Husain, 2018; Husain & Poiser, 2018). Behavioural manifestations of apathy include reduced engagement in goal-directed behaviours, such as work, hobbies, personal hygiene, and/or social interactions (Nyatsanza et al., 2003). Apathy is associated with a host of adverse outcomes, including accelerated cognitive decline, increased morbidity, and increased caregiver burden (Kiosses & Rosenberg, 2019; Breitve et al., 2018). Previous clinical trials attempting the use of dopamine agonists, cholinesterase inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have been met with variable success (Padala et al, 2007; Yuen et al., 2014; Rea et al., 2014). The lack of an effective pharmacological intervention is, in part, due to a poor understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying apathy. Recent works suggests that deficits in distinct neurotransmitter pathways may give rise to dissociable apathetic behaviours, and a more tailored approach to treatment is needed (Starkstein & Hayhow, 2019; Husain & Poiser, 2018). Uncovering cognitive deficits associated with apathetic behaviours thus provides an ideal route for identifying the affected neurotransmitter systems. As such, the proposed study aims to elucidate brain regions and genetic variants associated with neurotransmitter systems implicated in cognitive profiles related to apathetic behaviours in dementia patients. ","Atrophy in specific brain regions and polymorphisms in corresponding neurotransmitter pathways will be associated with dissociable behavioural and cognitive manifestations of apathy in neurodegenerative dementias, including FTD, AD, LBD, and VCI. "," The proposed study will use resting state fMRI data, genomic data (including APO-E 4, C9orf72 repeats, NeuroRx SNP, ONDRI seq, and exome sequencing), and data from the neuropsychological and cognitive batteries (including MoCA, NPI-Q, Sheenan Disability Scale, Judgment of preference task, DKEFS verbal fluency, IRI, IADL, Physical self-maintenance scale, and sequence story picture description)    ","(1) A principal component analysis (PCA) of the neuropsychological and cognitive battery data will be used to characterize dissociable cognitive components that correlate with scores of apathy on the NPI-Q. (2) A partial least squares correspondence analysis (PLS-CA) will be used to examine potential interactions between neuroimaging and genetic variables that may predict development of symptoms of apathy, as identified by the PCA.","If successful, the knowledge obtained from this study will inform the design of future clinical trials testing novel and specific therapeutic targets for symptoms of apathy in neurodegenerative dementias.

OND20200428JB,Jennifer Rabin,Investigating the impact of vascular risk factors on cognitive and brain health across neurodegenerative diseases ,"Vascular risk factors like hypertension, obesity, and diabetes have been associated with accelerated brain atrophy and cognitive dysfunction in the general population and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Gottesman et al., 2017; Gorelick et al., 2011; Luchsinger et al., 2005; Rabin et al., 2018; 2019; Snyder et al., 2015), and these effects may be exacerbated by Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status (Bangen et al., 2013; Haan et al., 2005). By contrast, much less is known about the influence of vascular risk factors on cognitive and brain health in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). This is an important question because there is a need to identify potentially modifiable risk factors that could slow neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in individuals at risk for dementia. The proposed study will examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of vascular risk factors on cognitive performance and brain atrophy in a large cohort of adults with AD, PD, FTD or cerebrovascular disease cohort. A secondary goal is to examine the modifying effect of APOE ε4 status on these associations.","The overarching aim of this study is to examine the impact of elevated vascular risk, as measured by the Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk score, FHS-CVD, (D'Agostino et al., 2008), on cognitive performance and brain atrophy across neurodegenerative diseases, and whether these associations are moderated by APOE ε4 status. We will also perform mediation analyses to examine the intermediary role of vascular brain injury on the association of vascular risk factors with cognition and brain atrophy.     Aim 1: To examine the association of vascular risk factors, as measured by FHS-CVD, with cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of cognition across neurodegenerative diseases, and whether this association is moderated by APOE ε4 status. Post hoc analyses will examine whether associations differ across cognitive domains of memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial processing. Post hoc analyses will also examine associations between individual risk factors and cognitive performance.    Aim 2: To examine the association of vascular risk factors, as measured by FHS-CVD, with cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of brain atrophy (global brain atrophy, ventricular size, hippocampal volume, cortical thinning) across neurodegenerative diseases, and whether this association is moderated by APOE ε4 status. Post hoc analyses will examine associations between individual risk factors and brain atrophy.    Aim 3: To examine whether markers of vascular brain injury (white matter hyperintensities, standard diffusion metrics, free-water diffusion metrics) mediate the association between vascular risk factors, as measured by FHS-CVD, with cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of cognition and brain atrophy across neurodegenerative diseases. Post hoc analyses will examine whether these associations are stronger in APOE ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers (i.e., a mediation-moderation analysis).    Hypotheses: Greater vascular risk will be associated with worse cross-sectional and longitudinal performance on measures of cognition (predominantly in the domain of executive function and memory) and greater brain atrophy (global atrophy, hippocampal volume). These associations will be moderated by APOE ε4 status in the AD group only. Mediation analyses will demonstrate a direct and indirect effect of vascular risk factors on cognition and brain atrophy across groups, such that measures of vascular brain injury (white matter hyperintensities, standard diffusion metrics, free-water diffusion metrics) will partially mediate these associations.  ","Demographics (age, sex, education, ethnicity, handedness, employment, marital status); Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, hip and waist circumference); Smoking, Alcohol use; Laboratory (biochemistry, hematology); Medical history (specifically history of diabetes); Concurrent medication; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); all neuropsychology data; SABRE (tabular summary of volumes); DTI (tabular summary of Fractional Anisotropy, Mean Diffusivity, Axial Diffusivity, Radial Diffusivity); Anthropometrics and clinical variables; APOE genotype.","Cross-sectional analyses will be performed with linear regression models and longitudinal analyses will be performed using linear mixed models. Mediation analyses will be performed with the 'mediation' package in R (Tingley et al., 2014). Covariates will include age, sex, education (when cognition is the outcome), and intracranial volume (when volume is used as an outcome). Analyses will be performed across all cohorts (controlling for diagnosis) as well as within each cohort.","This study will be the first to comprehensively assess cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of vascular risk factors with measures of brain and cognitive health across several neurodegenerative diseases. If successful, this study will bolster the rationale for aggressively targeting vascular risk factors as a potential approach to slow the progression of neurodegenerative disease."
OND20200506KB,KB Zaidi,The impact of glucose on cognition in neurodegenerative disease    ,"Higher levels of blood glucose have been linked to lower cognitive functions and higher incidence of dementia in individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Bissels et al., 2008). However recently, research from Kerri and colleagues (2013) demonstrated that long-term elevated glucose levels were associated with reduced memory performance even in healthy, nondiabetic older adults. These cognitive changes in part are explained by greater hippocampal volume reductions in individuals with chronically elevated blood glucose levels (Kerti et al., 2013). In addition, higher blood glucose levels have been linked to increased cerebral inflammation and activation of blood coagulation mechanisms. This leads to greater atrophy, cell death, and increased likelihood of stroke, TIAs, and volume loss (Mergenthaler et al., 2013). Further, impaired glucose metabolism precedes atrophy in Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and these two processes (impaired glucose metabolism and atrophy) are believed to be prodromal to the neurodegenerative process (Chetelat et al., 2008; Gonzalez-Redondo et al., 2014; Trost et al., 2019).  Additionally, research investigating the role of ApoE genotype demonstrates that AD patients with the APOE Ɛ4 allele exhibit a greater risk of diabetes, and presence of diabetes further increases the occurrence of tangles and plaques in AD patients carrying the Ɛ4 allele (Awad et al., 2010; Messier, 2003). As such, elevated glucose levels may be precursive mechanisms that exacerbate the neurodegenerative process leading to lower cognitive functioning in neurodegenerative disease and in healthy adults. To date, these associations have been measured using global cognitive screening measures such as the MoCA or MMSE, and little is known about the specific cognitive abilities involved. We are proposing two studies that investigate the association between blood glucose levels and cognition in the AD/ MCI and PD samples. ","The primary aim of these studies is to understand the association of blood glucose levels in neurodegenerative disease in non-diabetic individuals from a neuropsychological perspective. We will explore the relationship between blood glucose levels and measures of cognition in AD/MCI and PD samples. Based on previous studies implicating the hippocampus, we expect elevated glucose levels to have a greater effect on memory in comparison to other cognitive domains. As a secondary goal, we will examine whether glucose effects on cognition are mediated by changes in hippocampal volume and microstructure. In addition, we will examine the role of ApoE genotypes to understand whether ApoE Ɛ4 allele carriers exhibit greater deleterious effects of glucose on cognition.   ","•	Participant demographic information including disease severity and disease history variables  •	Lab data including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood glucose levels, insulin, blood pressure measures   •	Minimum neuropsychological dataset  •	Health questionnaires including depression, and anxiety measures   •	Hippocampal volume and microstructure measures   •	APOE genotyping   ","The proposed analyses will be conducted in each of the patient groups separately, AD/MCI and PD.  1.	To detect associations among glucose levels and specific cognitive domains, multiple regression analyses will be conducted to test whether higher glucose levels predict lower cognition after controlling for other known factors related to cognition (age, education, sex) and disease history (diabetes, smoking etc.).   2.	Secondary analyses will examine whether the relation between blood glucose and cognition is mediated by ApoE genotype and hippocampal volume.    ",To better understand the role of glucose in neurodegenerative disease which may aid in early intervention techniques that may have the potential to reduce or slow down the neurodegenerative process. 
OND20200606EF,Elizabeth Finger,Voxel-based symptom lesion mapping and voxel-based morphometry correlates of emotional and behavioural regulation in vascular cognitive impairment and frontotemporal dementia,"Patients who experience stroke or neurodegenerative disease vary in their symptom profile. Loved ones often notice changes in the patient's personality and emotional responses, which can be particularly burdensome (Diehl-Schmidt et al., 2013). Such changes are often associated with damage to an interconnected brain network involving prefrontal and subcortical areas, and include alterations in self-regulation, empathy, emotional reactivity and aggression. Relevant network areas are thought to include ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), basal ganglia (BG), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the amygdala (Barrash et al., 2018; Hornak et al., 2003; Levy et al., 2006; Mitchell, 2011). However, current neurocognitive models lack specificity, and the symptoms that emerge following damage to this network vary considerably. For example, whereas some individuals with 'OFC damage' appear apathetic and lack emotion, others are overly outgoing, exhibiting increased sensation seeking and reward sensitivity. The apparent discrepancy may exist because many lesion studies lack the spatial resolution, numbers, and analytical approaches needed to properly resolve this issue.  ","We will determine how combinations of neuropathology (stroke and FTD) to the vmPFC, OFC, BG and amygdala differentially map onto symptoms of emotional reactivity, reward seeking, social responsiveness, and apathy. We hypothesize that different combined patterns of prefrontal cortex and subcortical areas will determine the emergence of excessive reward seeking versus apathy, and social disinhibition versus social withdrawal (as measured by the RSMS, BIS/BAS and IASR-B5). Specifically, we predict that combined BG and ACC neuropathology will produce extreme apathy and social withdrawal. In contrast, lesions or atrophy restricted to anterior OFC and amygdala will be associated with increased reward seeking, social disinhibition and emotional lability (along with emotional empathy deficits; as measured by the IRI).","The proposed study will use structural MRI data, and data from specific questionnaire measures of behavior, emotion, and empathy (IRI, RSMS, IASR-B5, and BIS/BAS). For characterization purposes, the study will also utilize neuropsychological and cognitive batteries including MoCA, NPI-Q, Sheehan Disability Scale, Judgment of preference task, and the DKEFS verbal fluency.","We will use both voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) techniques to determine the impact of patterns of neuropathology on emotion-related symptomatology. VLSM groups participants for each variable according to the presence of a lesion on a voxel-by-voxel basis, yielding a t-statistic for each voxel (Campanella et al., 2014); it is particularly well-suited for lesion-symptom mapping in stroke (Geva et al., 2012). In contrast, VBM, is designed to assess local differences in tissue composition (after discarding gross anatomical differences) and is thus better suited to assess such associations with atrophy (neurodegeneration). Thus, by combining our two approaches in groups with stroke and neurodegenerative conditions (VCI and FTD), we will maximize our ability to map symptoms to neuropathological changes.","Changes in emotional and behavioural regulation following brain injury are still poorly understood. Using the proposed dual lesion-symptom mapping approaches in data from patients with VCI and FTD will provide insight into the causal roles that prefrontal and subcortical areas play in emotion-related symptoms. To our knowledge, this will be the first time that the two approaches are combined in patients with stroke and neurodegenerative disease to map emotion-related symptomatology. "
OND20200610MG,Maged Goubran,Neurodegenerative disease diagnosis using graph convolutional networks,"There is increasing evidence that neurodegenerative diseases including, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)/Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis spectrum disorders, can be viewed as network disorders that lead to complex progressive structural and functional brain changes. These diseases share some pathophysiological features, resulting in presentation and clinical symptoms that are difficult to disentangle. Structural imaging biomarkers alone are not sufficient for the immense challenges of accurate, early diagnosis and prediction of disease progression.  ","Aim: Diagnose the different diseases by employing connectivity information and structural metrics using a novel machine learning technique called graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and extract features that best classify them.   Hypothesis: A novel GCN will be able to accurately diagnose the four diseases based on rich patient data (connectivity and structural information along with clinical and cognitive measures).","MRI data   •	High-resolution structural scans (T1-weighted and T2-weighted scans)   •	Diffusion MRI (dMRI)   •	Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI)    Clinical measures  •	Age  •	Sex  •	Years of education   •	Montreal cognitive assessment tool (MoCA)  •	Diagnosis at baseline and follow-up   •	Family history    Neuropsychology tests  •	Composite scores (for domains) from the neuropsychology's platform PCA  •	RAVLT  •	BVMT-R  •	DKEFS  •	Trail making test    Genomic status (common and rare variants)  •	AD: APOE, TOMM40   •	PD: LRKK2, GBA, or SNCA  •	FTLD:  GRN, MAPT, C9orf72 G4C2  •       Polygenic risk score     ","Hippocampal and ventricular segmentations, and brain extraction will be performed using our novel deep convolutional neural nets. T1-w images will be segmented into different brain structures to compute connectivity. For graph convolutional networks, patient features will consist of imaging data including structural and connectivity information along with clinical, genomics and psychology measures. Graph nodes will represent individuals within a cohort (patients from either disease or controls) accompanied by a set of features (imaging and clinical markers), while graph edges will incorporate associations between subjects. Imaging features will include structural and functional connectivity, and brain regional and lesion volumes. The diagnosis task will be modeled as a multi-class node classification problem, where we aim to assign a label (either one of the diseases or control) to each graph node (subject). We will extract features that maximize the separation between diseases, to learn the best imaging and clinical features for diagnostic criteria. Graph clustering techniques will also be used to stratify patients into data-driven groups (clusters). We will then compare these groups with those based on clinical diagnosis. In addition to building our novel classifier, we will validate our accuracy (and confusion matrices) against other standard machine learning algorithm including random forests and Bayesian models. Longitudinal (follow-up) data will be used to validate our models and assess the cognitive progression of data-driven vs clinical groups.","The machine learning-based diagnostic model and features resulting from this work can help address the critical need for improved patient stratification, and has potential for translation into the clinic and clinical trials. Our data-driven approaches can highlight salient imaging, genomic and clinical features that help improve patient stratification and prediction of cognitive trajectories. "
OND20200710RB,Jennifer Rabin,Investigating brain maintenance and cognitive reserve across neurodegenerative diseases: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses,"Greater educational achievement has been associated with better late-life cognitive functioning and reduced risk of dementia (Meng and D'Arcy 2012; Roe et al. 2008; Kemppainen et al. 2008; Stern 2006, 2012). However, the mechanisms underlying this potential benefit remain poorly understood. Several concepts, which fall under the umbrella term 'resilience', have been used to describe this phenomenon, including brain maintenance and cognitive reserve (Stern et al. 2018). One challenge is that most studies on resilience have been carried out in clinically normal older adults or those with Alzheimer's disease (AD), with few studies examining these constructs in other conditions that affect brain functioning. The goal of the present cross-sectional and longitudinal proposal is to assess brain maintenance and cognitive reserve across a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). A secondary goal is to examine these concepts at different ages and stages of disease progression given that the direction and magnitude of the associations may differ along these trajectories (Stern et al., 1999).    In the present proposal, we define brain maintenance as the preservation of brain structure in the face of a neurodegenerative disease and cognitive reserve as the preservation of cognition in the face of a neurodegenerative disease (Stern et al., 2019). We will use greater educational attainment as a proxy of reserve (in Aims 1 and 2), total gray matter volume as a proxy of brain structure, and a global cognitive composite as a proxy of cognition. Follow-up analyses will examine regional volumes and specific cognitive domains. In Aim 3 we examine a broader range of reserve variables to identify common and unique combinations of protective factors that contribute to brain maintenance and cognitive reserve across neurodegenerative disorders.  ","Aim 1: To assess brain maintenance we will examine whether educational attainment is associated with gray matter volume within neurodegenerative disorders of AD PD, FTD, and CVD. H1: Greater education will be associated with slower gray matter volume loss within each disorder. Evidence of this association will provide support that brain maintenance is present across a range of brain disorders. Follow-up analyses will examine regional volumes and in post hoc analyses we will repeat the analyses stratified by age and extent of cognitive impairment.     Aim 2: To assess cognitive reserve we will examine whether educational attainment moderates the association between baseline gray matter volume and cognition within neurodegenerative disorders. H2: Greater educational attainment will moderate the association between gray matter volume and cognition within each disorder, such that there will be a weaker association between gray matter volume and cognition in those with greater education. Follow-up analyses will examine regional volumes and specific cognitive domains (e.g., episodic memory, executive function, language). As above, in post hoc analyses, we will repeat the analyses stratified by age and extent of cognitive impairment.    Aim 3: To identify the set of common and unique protective factors (in addition to educational attainment) that contributes to brain maintenance and cognitive reserve across neurodegenerative disorders of diseases. We will examine a large set of variables that have been associated with reduced dementia risk, such as cardiovascular risk factors, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, smoking habits, alcohol use, medications, markers of inflammation, and genetic markers (e.g., APOE4, BDNF, COMT) to determine the set of common and unique factors that contribute to brain maintenance and cognitive reserve across neurodegenerative disorders. H3: A subset of the aforementioned protective variables, including educational attainment, will contribute to brain maintenance and cognitive reserve across all of the studied disorders. In addition, we expect that the disease cohorts will have unique combinations of protective factors that contribute to brain maintenance and cognitive reserve.  ","Demographics (age, sex, education, ethnicity, handedness, employment, marital status); Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, hip and waist circumference); Smoking, Alcohol use; Laboratory (biochemistry, hematology); Medical history (specifically history of diabetes); Concurrent medication; Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); neuropsychology data (minimum data package); SABRE (tabular summary of volumes); Anthropometrics and clinical variables; genetic data (e.g., APOE4, BDNF, COMT); sleep measures, and depression measures.","Aims 1 and 2 will use linear regression (cross-sectional analyses) and linear mixed models (longitudinal analyses) to assess brain maintenance and cognitive reserve. Interaction terms will be used to examine whether associations differ by age or extent of cognitive impairment. In Aim 3a we will apply structural equation modeling to identify a set of common factors that contribute to brain maintenance and cognitive reserve across all disorders. In Aim 3b we will apply partial least squares analyses to investigate disease-specific signatures of brain maintenance and cognitive reserve. Covariates will include age, sex, race, and intracranial volume.",Successful completion of the present proposal will improve our understanding of proxies of resilience that are relevant to a range of neurodegenerative disorders.
